<br />At Half Moon Lake</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Indian Summer</span></span></h2>
<p>Two girls were following a narrow
trail.</p>
<p>About them the woods were scarlet
and flame, golden and bronze, and in
contrast the blue-green depth of tall pine
and cedar trees.</p>
<p>Down a steep hill the trail led; on either
side a thick underbrush of wild grapevines
and blackberries that twisted and sprawled,
showing shriveled clumps of seed pods where
formerly the fruit had ripened.</p>
<p>One of the girls, wearing a corduroy costume
of hunter&rsquo;s green and a tam-o-shanter
of the same shade, was carrying a rifle,
while over her shoulder hung a brace of
rabbits and half a dozen quail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<p>Following close behind her the second
girl&rsquo;s costume was of the same character,
a short skirt and coat with leather leggings
and high boots, but of dark blue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think we are lost, Gill?&rdquo; she
inquired cheerfully.</p>
<p>Her companion shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as David Murray says, we are
where we shouldn&rsquo;t be and don&rsquo;t know
where we are, but I should never call that
being lost, would you, Bettina?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grasping a small birch tree firmly so as
not to be obliged to continue her descent,
and forcing Bettina to imitate her example,
Gill turned halfway around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get down this hill and find our camp
before dusk I suggest that we follow the
fashion set by &lsquo;The Waters at Lodore&rsquo;.
I am not sufficiently literary to recall the
exact lines of the poem, I leave that to you,
Princess, but there was something about
their dashing, splashing and tumbling, something
quick and active, and in contrast to
our methods for this past hour. Farewell,
valor at present is the better part of discretion,
to transpose the axiom.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>As she ceased speaking, releasing the
slender young tree and bracing her feet
together, Mary Gilchrist began to slide
down the steep incline.</p>
<p>In the heart of the Adirondack forest it
was now early in the month of November
and about four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
Overhead the sun was still shining and the
sky a warm blue, yet from the ground arose
a light mist, playing in and out amid the
underbrush and the bases of the trees,
ethereal and evanescent, the floating draperies
of unseen fairies holding an autumn
carnival.</p>
<p>Bettina Graham continued her downward
progress more slowly and cautiously.</p>
<p>Over the trail beech leaves and birch
leaves and the long fingers of the pine had
blown in little drifts of amber and green
which, mixing with the decaying wood and
wet earth, formed a slippery aisle.</p>
<p>Ten minutes elapsed before Bettina rejoined
her companion. She then discovered
Mary Gilchrist seated upon an overturned
log, her gun and game on the ground beside
her, her hat in her lap, while she shook bits
of brushwood, twigs and leaves from her
hair and removed them from her apparel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The autumn sun shone through an arch
of branches overhead on the red-brown of
her hair, on her eyes so nearly the same
color, on her healthy, lightly freckled skin,
and her full, irregular lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad the turn in the trail concealed
the latter part of my prowess as a mountaineer,
Bettina. I certainly came down
swiftly enough toward the end. In fact, I
had hard work holding on to my rifle,&rdquo;
Gill announced, shaking her head a second
time so that a bronze leaf slid on to the
earth. &ldquo;But if I lost my dignity I did not
lose my gun or game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not hurt, are you, Gill?&rdquo;
Bettina asked, looking with admiration and
amusement at her companion.</p>
<p>Then as she shook her head:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Gill, it has been a curious
fact in our Camp Fire life together, living
as we have for the past few years in different
places and under such a variety of conditions,
to find here and there one of us
discover the environment for which she
must have been intended. Vera Lagerloff
and Alice Ashton, for instance, were at
their best when doing reconstruction work
in France. You, Gill, were very busy and
useful over there, and yet no one has known
the real <i>you</i> until these past few weeks in
the mountains. Yet why should this be
true when you lived all your past life in
the western prairie country until your
desire to drive a motor in France led you
to join our Camp Fire and help with the
relief work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sometimes feel that I have not yet
found my true environment. Do you
remember the wonderful new play Tante
read aloud the other evening, &lsquo;Beyond the
Horizon&rsquo;, whose theme is that each human
being must live in harmony with his own
nature, else he will never find happiness
or success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Gilchrist smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>&ldquo;I remember it after a fashion, but,
Bettina dear, please don&rsquo;t ask me to understand
literary subtleties. You know there
is no one in the world who cares less than
I for books, although to my shame I confess
it, but I don&rsquo;t believe I ever read or studied
voluntarily save when I thought it my duty.
Every interest with me is an outdoor interest
and I confess I have never loved any place
so well as these Adirondack forests. Somewhere
in my past I must have had an
Indian ancestor, not a squaw, but a great
chief who roamed these hills, hunting and
fishing, sleeping and living outdoors when
it was possible, because I feel at present
as if I never wished to do anything else,
except perhaps see my friends and family
now and then. But enough of conversation,
Bettina, woodsmen or woodswomen
we have been told were a silent race and
we must learn the law of the woods. What
I really would like to know is in what
direction we should travel to reach camp
in the shortest length of time. We have
been following a deer trail I believe that
has led us nowhere. However, we cannot
be many miles out of the way. We must
move now toward the west, and, Bettina,
let&rsquo;s not separate again, you know you have
no sense of direction once you are more
than a mile away from camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unable to dispute this assertion, Bettina
Graham, who was beginning to grow tired
while her companion appeared as fresh as
when they set out, followed obediently
beside her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>A half hour longer they walked, Gill
rarely hesitating, although keeping her compass
in her hand and glancing at it occasionally,
when suddenly both girls stopped short.</p>
<p>They were not alone in this portion of
the woods. Not far off some one else was
moving, finding the way slowly and uncertainly.</p>
<p>Mary Gilchrist glanced at her rifle, which
she carried with skill and assurance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine who can be in the
woods at so late an hour. I must try and
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placing her fingers on her lips the girl
uttered a shrill, clear call.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>A moment later she repeated the call.</p>
<p>Then both girls heard a voice shouting
in a tone of mingled terror and relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lost my path. Won&rsquo;t some one
come and find me? I can never manage
to reach you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lost knight in the dark forest, Bettina!
Well, these are the days when women are
the modern crusaders, so let us to the
rescue!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Not many minutes after, the two girls
came upon a young man of about twenty
lying gracefully outstretched on the ground
upon a fragrant bed of balsam, with an open
book in his hands.</p>
<p>As Bettina and Mary drew near he arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was resting,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;knowing
that you would have less difficulty in discovering
me if I remained quiet in one
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was so self-possessed and
self-assured that Bettina smiled, observing,
however, that Gill appeared annoyed.</p>
<p>Small wonder! Their faces were flushed,
their clothes covered with brambles from
their search, while he showed no sign of
discomfort. His hair, worn longer than
was usual, was of a bright gold, his skin
pallid and his cheeks slightly sunken,
making his long, curiously shaped gray
eyes more conspicuous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, one can see you have not disturbed
yourself,&rdquo; Gill returned. &ldquo;Yet if you wish
to be out of the woods before twilight, you
had best make <i>some</i> effort. Fortunately
I discovered the trail we were seeking while
looking for you. Please follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>She turned sharply and moved off, her
figure vanishing between the trees, every
inch of her body alert, vigorous, almost
boyish, with her rifle and game over her
shoulder.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the newcomer glanced at
her with an expression of disapproval,
while his eyes sought Bettina for sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a stranger in this locality,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;I intend spending the winter
at a cabin in one of the clearings. &lsquo;Long,
long is the autumn dream in these corridors
of heaven&rsquo;,&rdquo; he quoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Bettina answered; &ldquo;still,
I think it might be just as well not to discuss
the beauty surrounding us for a short
time and follow our guide. You cannot
depend on me and I am sure you appear
to be an equally unreliable woodsman.
Gill,&rdquo; Bettina called, realizing that Gill
was walking more rapidly than usual and
that they might be forced to run rather
than lose sight of her.</p>
<p>Out of breath they both were when
finally they caught up. A few yards farther
on, the path broadened, leading between
an avenue of sugar maples raining golden
leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have been hunting,&rdquo; the young
man remarked in an effort to induce Mary
Gilchrist to behave as if she were aware of
his existence.</p>
<p>The fact was too obvious to require an
answer, notwithstanding Gill nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you actually mean you have shot
and killed those pretty little things yourself,
those gentle, furry rabbits with their
soft eyes and cotton tails and the quail one
can hear calling to one another with their
sweet, throaty notes? The wild animals
one might be willing to destroy, although
I scarcely think that fair in their own
haunts. Surely a portion of this world
should be reserved to them as well! But
even when one reconciles oneself to the
idea of a man hunting, the thought of a
woman or girl being willing to kill is beyond
my conception.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina saw the hot color flood Gill&rsquo;s
cheeks, saw her bite her lips.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may now broaden your conceptions!
I have been hunting since I was
a little girl, was taught by my father a
good many years ago. Do you know I
have an idea, that were we to invite you
to have dinner with us to-night, no one
would enjoy the game I have just killed
more than you. There are so many people
in this world who like to sentimentalize
and leave the hard work to others, while
they enjoy the results. You were quite
willing to remain on your couch of balsam
needles this afternoon while we scoured the
woods in search of you. Your plan is an
excellent one, so long as it is successful.
Never do the difficult or disagreeable tasks;
always find some one to do them for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ordinarily gay and sweet tempered, Bettina
glanced at the younger girl in surprise.</p>
<p>If Gill were wounded by the stranger&rsquo;s
speech, her revenge had been swift and sure.
Evidently her point had struck home, since,
although he appeared angry, he made no
reply.</p>
<p>By this time they had reached a spot
so near their camp that Bettina herself
recognized the environment.</p>
<p>A white birch tree stood alone in a small
clearing, rising thirty feet in the air; on this
autumn afternoon the foliage was still so
dense that one could barely see the light
between the thick branches.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Their path led past this tree only a few
yards away.</p>
<p>The three of them paused.</p>
<p>Issuing from between the leaves came the
note of an animal, or bird, wild and plaintive,
yet unfamiliar.</p>
<p>In an instant Mary Gilchrist loaded her
rifle, lifted it and fired.</p>
<p>The same instant Bettina gave a quick
cry of warning. The next a small figure
fell from the tree, limp and headlong as a
wounded bird.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Half Moon Lake</span></span></h2>
<p>Bettina had the little figure stretched
out with the head sloping downward
and was opening her first aid kit
with trembling fingers when the others
reached her.</p>
<p>Blood was staining the little girl&rsquo;s Camp
Fire dress and bright crimson sweater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me some water at once, I don&rsquo;t
believe the wound is serious. You can trust
me, I am studying surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina was gone for several moments.</p>
<p>On her return she saw that the little
victim&rsquo;s eyes were open and that she was
attempting to talk. The wound had proved
only a flesh wound and the shot had not
lodged in her arm, notwithstanding, their
new acquaintance was making a careful
investigation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>A few feet away Mary Gilchrist stood,
never having moved, or offered a word of
apology, or of fear, or remorse. The face
was an odd one, animated, filled with color
and life; it was charming, yet once the color
and animation departed, except for the fine
eyes, the face was plain, the features were
so irregular, the nose sky tipped, the lips
too full, the chin revealing more character
than beauty. Extremely pale, her expression
at present was more sullen than
sorrowful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me walk back to camp, I should
like it better,&rdquo; the little girl insisted, when
Bettina and the stranger had volunteered
to carry her. Her arm was bound and
hung in an improvised sling.</p>
<p>Not many yards further on the smoke
of a camp fire could be seen in the late
afternoon haze.</p>
<p>The small procession walked three abreast
with Mary Gilchrist a few steps behind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;We, too, plan to spend the winter in the
Adirondacks, with our Camp Fire club, our
guardian and a few relatives and friends,&rdquo;
Bettina explained. &ldquo;We have a beautiful
camp on Half Moon Lake, but you will soon
see for yourself! The arrangement is a
good deal of a surprise. After a summer
in England<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> we intended to make a trip
through Ireland, but after a few weeks
found the country so unsettled we decided
to sail for home. Most of us were really
very glad. I was, because I had discovered
this little girl in Ireland by that time.
Chitty I told you was a Lancashire girl,
the daughter of a miner. She lived with
us in England and then ran away with her
father to Ireland, so we never expected to
see her again. Her name is really Elce.
Chitty is a queer, Lancashire word that
means a tiny, black kitten and was a title
the miners gave her, as their mascot. But
the name does not suit; Chitty is a blackbird
and has a magical voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina Graham smiled down at the little
girl of about twelve years of age, whose
uninjured arm was slipped through hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now in sight of our camp. See,
is it not lovely as I said? The Indians call
this locality &lsquo;Place Where the Storm Clouds
Met in Battle with the Great Serpent.&rsquo;
We call our camp, &lsquo;Tahawus,&rsquo; which means
cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man whistled softly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>They were descending a low hill, sparsely
covered with beeches, poplars and birch
trees and a few evergreens, where but the
thick growth evidently had been cleared
away. The hill led down into a narrow
valley, a broad stripe of shining ribbon.
In the center lay a lake upon which a motor
launch and several row boats were washing
softly to and fro. Beyond Half Moon Lake
rose an extraordinarily high mountain with
files of spruce trees stationed like sentinels
up and down. Over the mountain at this
hour showed the first pale glimmer of a
crescent moon. About an eighth of a mile
from the lake stood a wide, low cabin built
of logs with a generous veranda. Beside
it were two smaller cabins of perhaps only
two or three rooms, but connected with the
large house by enclosed runways.</p>
<p>In front of one of the smaller houses a
camp fire was burning. Wreaths of smoke
were curling out of the chimney of the
central cabin, as in spite of the Indian
summer days, the autumn nights were
cold.</p>
<p>Several girls in Camp Fire costumes were
preparing the evening meal over the open
fire, while three older women were walking
slowly up and down at no great distance
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay and have dinner with
us?&rdquo; Bettina said cordially. &ldquo;We both
are strangers to the life of the woods, yet
hospitality is one of its first laws. By the
way, I have not told you my name, nor
have you told me yours. I am Bettina
Graham, my father is Senator Graham of
Washington. My friend is Mary Gilchrist.
Gill, won&rsquo;t you speak for yourself? Do
come and walk beside us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mary Gilchrist made no rejoinder,
nor did the newcomer urge her. To Bettina
his manner if a little abstracted was perfectly
courteous, but between him and
Mary Gilchrist the antagonism, born of
their meeting, her recent impulsive action
had augmented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Drain, Allan Drain. I
beg your pardon, I did not realize I had
not introduced myself. I believe I did tell
you I was studying surgery. The choice
is not mine, it is what my family wish for
me, not what I wish for myself. I want to
be a poet, a great poet. I am almost glad
my health has broken down so I am forced
to spend this winter alone amid the everlasting
hills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Bettina felt slightly embarrassed, but
need not have concerned herself as she was
not in her companion&rsquo;s thoughts.</p>
<p>Entirely self absorbed, he had thrown
back his head, showing that his features
were strongly marked, his nose prominent,
the cheek bones high.</p>
<p>It struck Bettina that his star gazing at
present was inward and at his own dream
of his own star. He seemed a vain and
not a practical person. If Gill&rsquo;s estimate
of his character were severe, yet it might
hold a germ of truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you study surgery?&rdquo;
Bettina demanded. &ldquo;Still if one is a poet,
a real poet, I do not believe another profession
can keep one from fulfilling his gift.
One might not write so much poetry, but
it might be all the more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her companion shook his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are altogether wrong; that is
what too many people argue. A poet must
live his own life in freedom and among his
dreams. But one must eat, for even poets
require food. My own people are poor,
but I have an uncle who is a distinguished
surgeon and, as he has no children, wants me
to follow in his footsteps, and is willing to
pay for my education. Don&rsquo;t think I do
not see the greatness of surgery, but I am
entirely unfitted for the profession and the
life is too difficult. I don&rsquo;t like an active
existence; perhaps your friend was right:
I may prefer to leave the hard tasks to
others and only enjoy the results of their
effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tahawus camp was now only a few yards
away. Bettina turned and moved back a
few paces to join her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gill, go to your own room at once if
you prefer. I will explain how the accident
occurred. Of course you had no way of
guessing, but it may be painful to have to
confess before so large an audience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Gilchrist shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Princess, you are kind as ever, but
I must do my own confessing. I feel as if
I had no right to continue a member of our
Camp Fire after my behavior, when all
my life I have been warned against just
such recklessness. Why, except for the
good fortune I did not deserve, I might
have&mdash;&rdquo; but here Gill faltered and stopped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>She then moved on ahead and Bettina
saw her pause before the group of older
women. A moment after they were listening
to her story.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Bettina joined her in her
cabin, in the meantime having introduced
the young poet to Mrs. Burton, the Camp
Fire guardian, to Miss Patricia Lord, and
to her own mother.</p>
<p>She discovered Gill sitting on the edge
of her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to talk over matters with Tante
in the morning when we can be alone. Of
course she was very kind. Aunt Patricia,
however, told me what she likes to call the
plain truth. Bettina, do you think it my
duty to leave this fairyland as a punishment
for my behavior? Perhaps if I remain I
shall only get into a worse difficulty! Have
you ever in your life met anyone you disliked
so instinctively that you felt assured
the influence over you could only be for
evil? You may think me absurd as you
like, but the young man we met by accident
this afternoon immediately had that effect
upon me.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I may never see him again, in
fact I mean to make an effort not to see
him. I&rsquo;ll not come to supper, I do not wish
for any. You may give him my share.
One thing I do know we ought never to be
brought into contact with each other, and
yet now he is apt to appear at camp at any
moment and I shall be responsible, since
you would never have been able to discover
him had you been alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly Gill&rsquo;s chin went up and her
color returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think I am cruel really, do
you, Bettina, more so than the other girls?
I only shot the game because I heard Aunt
Patricia say Mrs. Burton required it and
there was no chance to buy fresh provisions
until the end of the week. However, I
don&rsquo;t believe I shall ever hunt again.
Perhaps in any case I had best not spend
the winter at Half Moon Lake; after all,
I may be happier at home! There are in
my character certain faults the Sunrise
Camp Fire has not yet found out. We
were too busy in France to think of ourselves
or of each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gill, what a depressed mood you
are in! It is most unlike you. Small
wonder you do not like our poet if already
he has had this influence upon you! By
the way, he is having a beautiful time at
this moment with Tante and mother and
I don&rsquo;t believe will ever trouble any of us.
It strikes me that he feels entirely superior
to girls and requires an older audience to
appreciate him. Farewell, of course I&rsquo;ll
bring you your supper. Chitty is not
suffering in the least and things will adjust
themselves in the morning when the poet
shall have disappeared and been forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hope of his disappearing,&rdquo;
Gill returned disconsolately. &ldquo;One does
not so readily dispose of one&rsquo;s evil genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, she joined with Bettina&rsquo;s laughter
at her expense.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Old Friends</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, thank goodness our youthful
guest has departed at last.
I was fearful that he would
stay so long we could not have our hour
together before bedtime. It is a magical
night; do you suppose it would do you any
harm, Polly, if for a little while we go outdoors?
Then perhaps we shall be safe from
interruption. I am afraid I am selfish
enough to want you to myself now and
then, dear, as I used to in the old days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, it was I who wanted you,
and too often failed to secure you. You
were the favorite then as you have been
ever since. This evening, for instance, you
so charmed the young poet that he completely
ignored the girls. In fact, you
flattered him as no one of the Camp Fire
girls would have condescended to flatter.
However, you doubtless have prepared
your own punishment, for I am convinced
he will expect you to read his poetry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we do slip out of doors for half
an hour. I will put on this old fur coat as
a protection against the cold, and the
night is divinely clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later the two women,
who were among the original group of Camp
Fire girls, stole quietly out of the cabin
and arm in arm walked down toward the
shores of Half Moon Lake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, Betty, how long you will be
able to endure the solitude of our winter
woods? I trust until after the snow falls;
it has been so long since we were together
in any intimate way. Yet I&rsquo;m afraid
you&rsquo;ll soon be growing lonely and anxious
for the society life you love and that loves
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Polly! You will not be able
to be rid of me so promptly. And why
should I be lonely with you and my own
Bettina here? Certainly I have seen but
little of either of you in these past years
when you have been living and working
in Europe. So long as my husband remains
in the West and my son at college I shall
stay with you until you, or more probably
Aunt Patricia, drive me away. Do you
know, Polly, actually I need to make my
own daughter&rsquo;s acquaintance, to earn her
affection and confidence as you possess it.
It is true, although I do not enjoy the
confession, that I do seem to understand
boys better than girls and more easily
make friends with them. Tony and I have
always been more intimate than I have
ever managed to be with Bettina. The
Slim Princess, as Andrew calls her, has
been her father&rsquo;s daughter more than mine.
Polly dear, how have you managed to be
so successful a Camp Fire guardian so
many years? Frankly, I did not think it
was in you! You were more reserved as
a girl, more self-centered than the rest of
us, because of course you were a genius,
dear, and that means one must lead a
more introspective life. Yet you have
managed to be an artist and a wonderful
Camp Fire guardian as well. How many
different temperaments you have seen unfolded,
how many girls you have helped
through an infinite variety of experiences!
I wonder if the other mothers are as jealous
of you as I am?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, Betty,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton
answered, none too amiably, since as
a matter of fact amiability was not one of
her ruling traits of character. &ldquo;I have
simply had a good time with my Sunrise
Camp Fire girls, been as much of a friend
to them as I have known how to be. And
they have borne with my bad health and
bad tempers with amazing sweetness and
understanding. In truth, you realize, Betty,
that this winter in the Adirondacks is not
what I had hoped and planned for this
winter. With all my heart I wished to go
back to my stage work! I had discovered
a wonderful new play and was intending
to begin rehearsals as soon as I reached
New York. Then this abominable illness
of mine returned while we were in Ireland.
I took a severe cold over there amid the
Irish mists. So between my husband and
Aunt Patricia Lord and half a dozen
doctors, no choice was left me. The Camp
Fire girls are here in the mountains with
me for my consolation more than for their
pleasure, I am afraid. We will have a
shut-in winter together in this fairy land.
I sometimes wonder what may happen to
us after a time when the snows begin and
this place is a great ice palace. But surely
it is too lovely for me to complain! Look,
dear, the evening star is just going down
beyond the farthest hill:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Thou fair-haired Angel of the Evening,</p>
<p class="t0">Now while the sun rests on the mountains, light</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bright torch of love&mdash;thy radiant crown</p>
<p class="t0">Put on, and smile upon our evening bed!</p>
<p class="t0">Smile on our loves; and, while thou drawest the</p>
<p class="t0">Blue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew</p>
<p class="t0">On every flower that shuts its sweet eyes</p>
<p class="t0">In timely sleep. Let thy west wind sleep on</p>
<p class="t0">The lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">And wash the dusk with silver. Soon, full soon,</p>
<p class="t0">Dost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide,</p>
<p class="t0">And the lion glares through the dun forest.</p>
<p class="t0">The fleeces of our flock are covered with</p>
<p class="t0">Thy sacred dew; Protect them with thine influence.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Then was a brief silence; the woods
were still at the moment, the two friends
speechless and there was only the light
lapping of the waters against the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Polly O&rsquo;Neill Burton, long ago I was told
that Sara Bernhardt could make men and
women shed tears simply by reciting the
multiplication table or the alphabet. I
believe you can accomplish the self-same
result. I presume that you feel you have
grown stale with these years of abandoning
your art, yet I sincerely believe that when
you return to the stage you will be the
greater artist. No human being with
your temperament, Polly, can have passed
through the emotional experiences of the
years in Europe and not be inspired by
them. I am sorry for your present disappointment,
sorry you must wait another
year to produce the new play, yet when the
time arrives I shall be prouder of you
than ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, Betty. I hope you are
a prophet as well, because sometimes I
am afraid that my day as an artist is past.
One so quickly is forgotten and I have
been away from my audiences for so long
a time. However, I don&rsquo;t intend to be
dismal. I am not permitted to be, as a
matter of fact, by Aunt Patricia. At the
mildest protest on my part, she is unmerciful;
I suppose that is why I do my
complaining to you, Betty. Was there
ever such a character as Aunt Patricia?
I believe she grows fiercer in manner and
kinder in heart with each passing year.
Her reconstruction work in France was so
remarkable that the French government
wished to present her with a medal of
honor, which Aunt Patricia was about to
refuse with scant courtesy when I induced
her to allow me to write the letter of thanks
at the time she declined the offer. There
are moments when she is so autocratic I
feel I must rebel and yet I am utterly devoted
to her and under eternal obligations.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;So are we all, Polly, since she saved
your life in France and may be saving it
again with her care of you this winter.
So don&rsquo;t behave like an unruly child.
You do manage to keep absurdly young,
Polly. Molly, your own twin sister, and
I have confessed to each other that we
feel ten years your senior. Is it because
you are a genius or because you have
remained the guardian of the Sunrise Camp
Fire girls and been with girls so much
that you continue one of them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;I decline to answer. Remember, Betty,
it was you and not I who captured the
young poet&rsquo;s attention this evening. I
wonder if he is to be our nearest neighbor
during the winter? I trust not, for I
believe he would be of small service should
we get into a difficulty. We are more apt
to be forced to look after him. By the way,
Betty, I am glad the William Blake poem
did not invoke a shiver in you. It struck
me that the suggestion of the wolf raging
wide through the dun forest was unpleasantly
suggestive, although we are assured
that the wolf has vanished from the Adirondack
Mountains as surely as the Indian
braves and that only their ghosts haunt
their beloved woods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again for a few moments there was a
renewed silence, the two friends of many
years with their arms entwined about each
other continuing to walk up and down
contemplating the exquisite landscape under
the approaching shadow of the night.</p>
<p>Nearly of the same height, Polly O&rsquo;Neill
Burton, who in social life was Mrs. Richard
Burton, was far slenderer than her companion,
giving her an effect of greater
youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Betty Graham, who had been Betty
Ashton in former days, had grown from a
pretty girl into a rarely beautiful and
charming woman, distinguished for her
grace of manner and social gifts. She
was more beautiful than her friend. Even
as a girl Polly O&rsquo;Neill had never been
beautiful in any conventional fashion. Her
face was long, her features slightly irregular,
with a broad, low brow and delicate, pointed
chin. She had a wealth of dusky black
hair and amazing blue eyes of swiftly
changing color and expression and a wide,
mobile mouth.</p>
<p>Once long ago Betty Ashton had said:
&ldquo;One never is aware of the fact that Polly
possesses any other features than her eyes
and mouth. Her eyes always hold your
attention until she begins to speak and
then the movement of her lips, the haunting
quality of her voice absorb one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-night the figure which moved beside
her seemed to be thinner and frailer than
at any time since her marriage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Trying Miss Patricia might be upon
occasions, yet at present Betty Graham
could only rejoice at the thought of her
constant vigilance. Equally devoted she
and the Camp Fire girls might be, yet
they possessed neither the wisdom nor the
authority of Miss Patricia. She remembered
that although pliable in small matters,
in any question of her art Polly O&rsquo;Neill
had been singularly obstinate. Had she
not in her girlhood disappeared from her
family and friends and in defiance of their
wish devoted herself to her career?</p>
<p>At present would she remain shut up
in the winter woods with the new play
waiting to be produced and New York
City only a few hours away?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you study your new part,
Polly, while you are growing stronger?
Would it not help to keep you amused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, only make the waiting more trying.
I have promised my husband and Aunt
Patricia to devote this winter to my health.
I shall keep my word, but beyond this
winter I have made no promise. Betty,
did you hear a strange sound? I am
very nervous to-night and seem often to
hear voices in the wind and murmurings
as if all the fairy folk were whispering
together. No, I am not mad; remember,
Betty, how nearly I came to being born
in Ireland, where not to believe in fairies
is to forswear one&rsquo;s birthplace. Besides,
I often try to reproduce the sounds I hear
in nature. It is a great training for one&rsquo;s
voice. And this aids one in acting. Suppose
we go back now to the cabin. I want
to see that my Camp Fire girls are
ready for bed. A narrow escape from a
tragedy this afternoon and yet Mary Gilchrist,
Gill I prefer calling her, is usually
the most sensible one of us. One&rsquo;s guardian
angel seems to take a holiday now and
then, and yet Gill&rsquo;s saved her in the end.
Good gracious, here comes Aunt Patricia!
I vainly hoped she would not discover that
we were out of doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through the darkness a tall, severe
figure could be seen moving with long,
masculine strides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly O&rsquo;Neill, is this the fashion in
which you endeavor to regain your health?
I presume you go out into the night air
because you know it is so particularly bad
for you and in order to give additional
trouble to the people who are compelled
to care for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a warm, clear night, Aunt Patricia.
Besides, no one, as you say, is compelled
to care for me. When I am so ill as to be
especially troublesome I can send for a
nurse. Betty and I were just going indoors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Miss Patricia grunted in a
tone of doubt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham laughed, slipping her arm
affectionately through that of Miss Patricia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really were coming indoors. But
look here, Aunt Patricia, if Polly and the
Camp Fire girls object to being treated
as if they were young and in need of advice
and sometimes of discipline, while I am
with you, suppose you devote yourself to
me. It would be delightful to be treated
as if I were a girl again, instead of the
mother of a grown-up son and daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a lovable nature, Betty
Graham, which I think your daughter,
Bettina, has in a measure inherited. Polly
O&rsquo;Neill Burton, I regret being forced to
speak of it, is a spoiled and ungrateful
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton, who had been walking a
few feet apart from her companions, now
flushed and laughed. Catching up, she
slipped her hand through Miss Patricia&rsquo;s
free arm, resting her head for an instant
against the angular shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;I may be the one, but you know I am
not the other, Miss Patricia Lord! Besides,
I am as ashamed of you as I am of myself
for being in such a bad temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at our cabin how beautiful it is!
Let us ask Tahawus, the great cloud, to
keep us under his shelter for the night.
I hope the Camp Fire girls are safe in bed.
Sometimes, Betty, I could wish that none
of them need ever grow older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wish in which they would scarcely
concur, Polly. One wants the life adventure
whatever it may be. Besides, our Camp
Fire builds for the future as well as for
the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having reached the veranda, Bettina
Graham, hearing the voices outside, came
to open the front door; wearing a heavy
blue flannel wrapper over her blue pajamas,
her bare feet were thrust into blue slippers
and around her small head her hair was
closely bound in yellow braids.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been waiting to say good-night.
Of course I realized that any truants would
be you and Tante, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bettina,&rdquo; her mother replied irrelevantly,
&ldquo;you should have been called
Diana; your own name has never suited
you in the least and it was absurd that
you should have been named for me when
you are so unlike me. Since I have been
watching you here in these woods&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina and Mrs. Burton laughed and
even Aunt Patricia smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it my present costume which recalls
the famous huntress, mother, or is it that
the woods are making you romantic?
Please remember that I do not enjoy being
reminded that I am wholly unlike my
beautiful mother. I too have wished for
auburn hair&mdash;wine colored our young poet
called it to-night, did he not?&mdash;and eyes
like&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to bed, Bettina. There is nothing
of the goddess about you in manner or
behavior at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s tone was half amused
and half annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, you will receive the poems
in the morning. Gill and I really rescued
the poet and deserve the attention,&rdquo; Bettina
answered, as she ran away to bed,
tall and slim, with a peculiar grace of
movement which ever had been characteristic
of her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">The Hermit</span></span></h2>
<p>In the return of the Camp Fire girls to
their own country there was one of the
girls who was unreservedly glad. Not
one word of regret, not an instant of repining
for foreign lands, or scenes or friends,
and this girl was Sally Ashton, notwithstanding
the fact that Sally actually had
been through more entertaining experiences
than the other girls. However, these
experiences had made but slight spiritual
impression upon her, for Sally was a matter-of-fact
and not an emotional person. She
had nursed Lieutenant Fleury under curious
circumstances in the story called
&ldquo;The Camp Fire Girls on the Field of
Honor&rdquo;, but neither then nor afterwards
had the young French lieutenant&rsquo;s gratitude
and affection for her wakened more
than a friendly response. The same result
followed her acquaintance with the young
Englishman in &ldquo;The Camp Fire Girls
in Merrie England.&rdquo; Calmly Sally had
announced in both instances that her own
affection was indissolubly bound up with
her own country and that her one desire
was to return to the United States and
to spend the rest of her life there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>At present living with the Camp Fire
girls in their cabin in the Adirondacks,
Sally had become her placid and contented
self. The war was over and she need not
reflect upon the past, since it was of no
avail to make herself unhappy with old
memories.</p>
<p>Moreover, although not particularly fond
of the mountains, Sally preferred living
in the country to the town and was now
particularly pleased with their household
arrangements.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>The camp in which they were planning
to spend the winter was a more expensive
mode of living than the Camp Fire girls
appreciated and was possible only because
of Miss Patricia Lord. Upon Captain and
Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s small estate, the last few
years in Europe had made serious inroads.
Indeed, one of the reasons for Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
desire to return to her stage career
was in order to increase their fortune.
Her husband, Captain Richard Burton,
was a number of years her senior and
although an actor at the time of their
marriage had no desire to continue his
former profession. In the past years of
Red Cross work he had lost interest and
was out of touch with his old life and at
present was continuing his Red Cross
work, holding a position at a small salary
in Washington.</p>
<p>None of these details of other lives
disturbed Sally Ashton. She was merely
aware that their new camp was beautiful
and comfortable and that she had the
right to look forward to a long and peaceful
winter. She and her sister, Alice, had
spent a few months with their mother and
father near Boston in the interval of their
return from England and their arrival in
the Adirondacks and were expecting their
mother and father as guests at Christmas.
Indeed, there were plans for a Christmas
house party which would tax the capacity
of the big cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Ordinarily the Camp Fire work was
divided so that the girls were allowed to
devote their energies to the tasks they
preferred, and as Sally was more domestic
in her tastes than any member of the
Sunrise Camp Fire group, she was frequently
allowed first choice.</p>
<p>At present she had elected to have charge
of the big living-room of the cabin and
at this moment was engaged in putting
it in order.</p>
<p>She looked extremely young and pretty
in her big blue apron which she wore over
a brown serge frock, the girls having concluded
to lay aside their khaki costumes,
except on ceremonial occasions, because of
the cold. Her brown hair, parted a little
at one side, was brushed smoothly down
across her forehead and into a large soft
coil at the back of her head. Over it she
wore a net, but little tendrils of curling
brown hair showed on her temples and
throat. Sally&rsquo;s skin, ordinarily of a clear,
warm pallor, was at present at its loveliest
because she was especially happy and well.
To Sally happiness meant peace and contentment
rather than intensity of emotion
or the constant movement of events.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>She leaned down now to thrust some
white birch sticks under the great log that
smouldered at the back of the mammoth
fireplace. Behind the cabin the winter
fire logs were piled so high as to suggest
an old time pioneer fortification prepared
against an attack by the Indians.</p>
<p>Then when Sally arose she glanced about
the big room.</p>
<p>The floors were covered with thick,
brightly colored rugs for warmth and
cheerfulness. Until the advent of the
Sunrise Camp Fire girls, the room had been
conspicuously a man&rsquo;s room. As a matter
of fact, Tahawus cabin had been erected to
serve as a clubhouse for a group of wealthy
men who wished to enjoy the winter sports.
But losing interest, Miss Patricia Lord had
been able to rent it for the year.</p>
<p>In the center of the room stood a long,
heavy oak table sufficiently large for any
number of books, magazines and newspapers.
The chairs were upholstered in
brown leather, while upon the stained walls
were several fine paintings of scenes in
the Adirondacks. The sofa was long
enough for two of the Camp Fire girls to
find repose at the same time. Above the
mantel was a magnificent elk&rsquo;s head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>As a man&rsquo;s club room, the room may
have been appropriate, but for their purpose
the Camp Fire girls and their guardian
found it unsympathetic. The changes
they had made were not important, and
yet its entire character had altered.</p>
<p>On the mantel were the Camp Fire
candlesticks holding the three Camp Fire
candles and Indian baskets and jars filled
with autumn leaves, bright red berries and
branches of bayberry.</p>
<p>To-day on the center table was a big
bowl of golden roses sent to Mrs. Burton
by an admirer of her work who but recently
had learned of her return to the United
States. There was a basket of brightly
colored wool, the property of Mrs. Graham,
who rashly had promised to knit each member
of the Camp Fire a new sweater before
the winter was over.</p>
<p>On a smaller table was Sally&rsquo;s own basket
of silk. Notwithstanding the amusement
of the other girls, she had begun to piece
together an old-fashioned octagonal quilt,
following a pattern of half a century before.</p>
<p>Indeed, there were many feminine evidences
about the room, some of them too
subtle to be recognized immediately.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>Satisfied with her scrutiny, Sally seated
herself in a large chair before the fire.</p>
<p>Breakfast had been over for an hour or
more and the big cabin was almost empty.
Miss Patricia Lord was outdoors giving
orders to the man who came in the mornings
and afternoons to look after the furnace
and do whatever work it was impossible for
the girls to accomplish. Mrs. Burton was
in her own room writing letters or resting.
Mrs. Graham, Bettina and Marguerite
Arnot had driven over to Saranac, several
miles away, to do some important shopping.
The other girls were studying in one of the
smaller cabins. It was one of the rules
for the winter that each member of the
Sunrise Camp Fire club should devote
three hours a day to some kind of fairly
serious study save on holidays.</p>
<p>Sally personally felt that she should
follow their righteous example and yet at
the present moment could scarcely make
up her mind to be so virtuous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Slipping a box from her pocket, she
placed a chocolate between her small white
teeth. The box had come through the
mail the other day with a note from Dan
Webster, her old childhood friend. In
Paris he had suggested that she should
come home before her other friends. He
now expressed himself as pleased at her
return. The letter struck Sally as not so
enthusiastic as she had the right to expect.
Dan Webster always had been her especial
friend since they were children. However,
he was busy, having recently taken full
charge of his father&rsquo;s farm in New Hampshire,
so Sally presumed he was too absorbed
to give much thought to her.</p>
<p>Hearing a sound outside in the hall, she
got up and went to the open door. The
hall was nearly half the size of the living-room
with a second large fireplace. Mary
Gilchrist had just come in from the outdoors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Gill, I thought you were out for
an early morning walk! I heard Bettina
say we were not to expect you at breakfast
as you had made yourself a cup of coffee
and some toast and would not return until
we had finished. How white you look!
Are you worrying over what almost happened
yesterday? Gill, it bores me so to
have people worry over the tragedies or
the misfortunes that do not occur. Alice
says that is because I have a practical and
unemotional nature. Perhaps that is true,
I do not know; it only seems to me a waste
of time and energy. Elce was not hurt
yesterday, not seriously. She slept perfectly
and says her arm is not painful.
Yet you look as if you were seriously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Gilchrist, who was sometimes called
Gill and sometimes Mary by the other
Camp Fire girls, smiled at Sally&rsquo;s matter-of-fact
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a comfortable person, Sally,
and usually I agree with what you have
just said and try to follow your illustrious
example. Only at present I feel as if I
ought to do some kind of penance for my
fault. I came to have a quiet talk with
Mrs. Burton, and to ask her if she feels I
have forfeited my right to be a member of
her Camp Fire group.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smiling, Sally shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you need not trouble over any
criticism from Tante! Only on the most
unexpected occasions is she ever stern and
I am sure she will appreciate that you
were sufficiently frightened not to be so
reckless a second time. By the way, I
must tell you something amusing in order
to cheer you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;Early this morning as I was coming to
breakfast I heard some one at the front
door. Opening it I discovered the youth
you and Bettina rescued yesterday. He
was wearing a bright scarlet tam-o-shanter
and a velvet coat and had a crimson scarf
about his neck, and really looked rather
handsome. I met him at dinner yesterday
evening, but he was not in the least concerned
in speaking to me and made no
pretence of recognizing me. At once he
demanded Mrs. Graham. When Aunt
Betty came out into the hall he thrust a
leather case into her hands and asked her
to read his collection of unpublished
poems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Betty was of course very sweet
and gracious about it, but I heard her moaning
over the fact afterwards that actually
there are fifty poems. Bettina counted.
She and Tante were laughing over the fact
after breakfast, since Aunt Betty insists
she detests poetry and has scarcely read a
line of it in years. However, the poet
appeared to think she would be delighted
with the opportunity!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Mary Gilchrist frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish the poet and his poetry
might vanish together. In fact, if I knew
where Mrs. Graham had placed the masterpieces
I should like to light a blaze with
them. It is absurd of me, Sally, but I took
a dislike to the youth and afterwards my
own behavior made me dislike him the
more, as though he were partly responsible.
But do go for a walk, Sally, you love the
indoors as much as I do the open country.
It is a wonderful morning and will do you
lots of good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, slightly against her
will, as she preferred the open fire and her
sewing, Sally Ashton and the little Lancashire
girl started for a walk together. Mrs.
Burton had sent word that Chitty was in
need of amusement and Sally had volunteered
her services.</p>
<p>Now like children they danced through
the pine woods behind the camp, sometimes
walking sedately, at others running a few
steps, frightening the squirrels and chipmunks,
who came out and seated themselves
on the upper branches of the trees
to chatter and scold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;You do not appear in the least uncomfortable
from your injury yesterday,&rdquo; Sally
remarked, after protesting that they walk
more quietly. &ldquo;Nevertheless, suppose we
sit down and rest for a few moments. I
am not a gypsy, although I remember you
once said that you would like to be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger girl, who was a daughter of
an English miner, sat down on a bed of pine
needles facing Sally, who preferred the trunk
of a riven tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I used to talk of wishing to be a
gypsy, but that was before I went to Ireland
with my father and we attempted to live
like gypsies. Then we used to go about
through the villages, where I had to sing in
the streets for pennies in the wind and rain
and cold. Sometimes we slept indoors but
more often in stables and lofts, until I was
often too weary to sing. Then my father
grew tired of the wandering life and wished
to return to the army. Now I think what
I wished was to live in a forest like this and
always to be happy and free.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s brown eyes were slightly puzzled.
The little girl&rsquo;s nature was an enigma to her,
as it was to most persons. Freedom seemed
Chitty&rsquo;s one dream, and yet she could
scarcely have known what the great word
signified even for her own small, individual
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you sing for me if you feel well
enough, Chitty. I have not heard you for
a long time, you only sing when you are out
of doors unless some one urges you. I am
sleepy, so you can feel as if you were almost
entirely alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally lifted up her head to watch a gleam
of golden sunlight slant through the exquisite
cool darkness of the pine branches and
to see the long, delicate fingers of the pines
tremble in the light winds.</p>
<p>Then suddenly her eyes dropped toward
her lap.</p>
<p>If she were not musical, if she were not
emotional, if she cared little for the outdoors
and more for the sheltered places and life&rsquo;s
serenities, yet the little Lancashire girl&rsquo;s gift
set even her pulses stirring.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Scarcely a proper definition to call the
variety of sounds which Chitty poured forth
with the ease and unconsciousness of a
mocking-bird, singing. There were trills,
gay and high and poignant, then a low note
like a sob, then light ripples like wind blowing
over the water, then bold, straightforward
whistles, or the plaintive notes of a
wood dove.</p>
<p>Never had the effect been more magical
to Sally&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, without being aware of
any particular reason, she turned her eyes
and glanced in another direction.</p>
<p>Seated not many yards away and directly
facing her was one of the strangest figures
she had ever seen. The man was so nearly
the color of the bark of the tree that he
might have been carved out of wood. His
hair and skin were a coppery brown, he had
a short beard of the same shade and eyes
that were only slightly more brown. He
did not look very old, although his clothes
were old and shabby. He wore a leather
coat and knee breeches and was without a
hat. Listening with absolute intensity to
Chitty&rsquo;s music, he seemed scarcely aware of
their existence.</p>
<p>When she ceased, he got up and Sally saw
that he apparently wished to speak to them,
and yet could not make up his mind to alarm
them.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Sally was not in the
least frightened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">A Conversation and a Loss</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I have not spoken to any human
being in more than a month,&rdquo; the
stranger said in dull, even tones as if
he were deaf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Sally Ashton inquired in her
usual matter-of-fact fashion. &ldquo;There are
many people who come to the Adirondack
forests and there are towns and villages and
cities not many miles away. You must
choose not to speak to anyone. Are you a
hermit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man answered slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call myself a hunter and a woodsman.
My cabin is a good many miles from any
road and in the summer when the mountains
are filled with tourists I remain near
my own place. But now that the winter is
approaching and the woods beginning to
be deserted save by those of us who live
here I roam about in search of food and
change of scene.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have you always lived here?&rdquo; Sally
demanded with her accustomed bluntness.
&ldquo;Otherwise you must be in hiding because
of some trouble or secret you wish to conceal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the man stared in silence,
either angry or amazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not lived here always,&rdquo; he replied
evasively, &ldquo;but there are men in these
woods who have been here since boyhood.
One day you may meet a backwoodsman
who is a great preacher here in God&rsquo;s tabernacle
of the outdoors. You have not told
me why I find you in the forest when the
autumn days are passing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am afraid you will not find this
portion of your woods deserted for many
months. With a number of other girls and
some older friends we intend spending the
winter in these hills. But good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stretching forth her hand, Sally took hold
of the younger girl&rsquo;s, intending to walk
back to their own cabin. If their new acquaintance
did not alarm her, there was
something in his manner which rendered
her uncomfortable.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">For a Moment the Man Stared In Silence</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>He was not glancing toward her at the
present instant, but toward the little English
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who taught you to sing in that fashion?&rdquo;
he inquired. &ldquo;But there, that was a stupid
question! No one could have taught a
child like you. You have a great gift and
for a little while were able to make me
forget what I have not forgotten in many
years. Some day I may again be your
uninvited audience. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the two girls stood watching the
figure disappear into a denser portion of the
woods, and Sally said with a little frown:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Odd! At first I was under the impression
that our new acquaintance was a backwoodsman,
I mean a man without an
education except a knowledge of the outdoors,
but now I am uncertain. In fact, I
am sure he was once a different character
of person and came to the forest to escape
some sorrow or wrong doing. However, as
I hate mysteries I trust we shall not meet
him again; probably we never shall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Since the encounter had really been of
no importance and there were many other
things on her mind, an hour later Sally had
forgotten the occurrence. In truth, at the
time it did not appear to her or to Chitty
as of sufficient interest to mention to any
member of the Camp Fire.</p>
<p>During the afternoon for several hours
Sally remained in the study in the smaller
cabin working at her French and writing a
letter in French to a member of the first
Camp Fire club established in the city of
Paris. Then, at a quarter before four, she
disappeared to her own room, where she
made a quick toilet and came down to the
big living-room in the main cabin.</p>
<p>From four to five o&rsquo;clock was the pleasantest
hour of the day. The habit of afternoon
tea so firmly established during the summer
in &ldquo;Merrie England&rdquo; was now continued
under different conditions in the heart of
the North woods.</p>
<p>Nearly all the members of the Sunrise
Camp Fire who were together for the winter
season, Sally found seated in a wide circle
before the open fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Standing beside the tea wagon, which she
had just rolled into the room, was her own
sister, Alice Ashton, who had remained in
France with Miss Patricia Lord and Vera
Lagerloff to continue the reconstruction
work after the other Camp Fire girls had
crossed to England with their Camp Fire
guardian.</p>
<p>Alice Ashton was a tall, serious girl with
reddish hair and blue eyes, entirely unlike
Sally in appearance and disposition.</p>
<p>Kneeling before the fire at this moment
and toasting thin slices of bread to a beautiful
brownness was Vera Lagerloff, who
was an American girl notwithstanding her
foreign name. This was due to the fact
that her parents were Russians. Vera was
born in the United States and was an
American enthusiast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>Not far away seated in a low chair, a pile
of lavender silk in her lap, was Marguerite
Arnot, her dark head bent over her work.
Older than the other Camp Fire girls by a
year or more, Marguerite Arnot was actually
a French girl who had been received as a
member of the Sunrise Camp Fire under
exceptional conditions. Brought into their
household in &ldquo;Glorious France&rdquo; as Miss
Patricia Lord&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;e, later she had become
one of their number. Her presence
in the United States was due to the fact
that she had yielded to Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s and
to Bettina Graham&rsquo;s persuasion and had
decided to make her home in America and
to go on with her work. Of gentle breeding
and education, Marguerite Arnot and her
mother were dressmakers in Paris, until
her mother&rsquo;s death during the war had left
the girl ill and alone. Not long after she
had the good fortune to make the acquaintance
of Miss Patricia Lord.</p>
<p>At present Miss Patricia Lord was seated
behind the rest of the group, reading a
lengthy report she recently had received
from France, concerning a home for war
orphans that she was building in the neighborhood
of one of the great French battlegrounds.
Every now and then, however,
her glance wandered from the paper in her
hand to the figure of a younger woman,
half seated and half reclining in a great
chair near the tea table.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton, the Camp Fire guardian,
whose figure was more slender than a young
girl&rsquo;s, was wearing a heavy, red-corded silk
tea gown; the firelight playing on her dusky
hair, on her white face with the long delicate
chin and high cheek bones.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Seated on a stool beside her, with her
head resting in the palms of her hands,
was the youngest member of the household,
the small daughter of an English miner.
Chitty&rsquo;s hair was even blacker than Mrs.
Burton&rsquo;s, her skin darker and more sallow,
and her eyes large, black and wistful. A
peculiarity of the little girl was that she
rarely ever talked unless a question were
addressed to her directly, expressing herself
chiefly through her music.</p>
<p>At a table with her back to the others,
Mary Gilchrist, who recently had requested
the Camp Fire girls to use her father&rsquo;s name
for her, Gill, rather than Mary, apparently
was deeply engaged with a history of the
North woods which she seemed to be reading.
Ordinarily one of the gayest and most
animated of the group of Camp Fire girls,
since her reckless action the day before she
had been uncommonly silent and subdued.</p>
<p>Bettina Graham and her mother had not
yet entered the room and tea had not been
served.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Sally dear? I have scarcely
seen you all day. Tell me what you are
thinking of while you stand there studying
our Camp Fire circle.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>The other girls, attracted by Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s
speech, looked over toward Sally, who
often was unexpectedly amusing.</p>
<p>Coming further into the room, Sally stood
close beside the Camp Fire guardian&rsquo;s
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want really to hear what I was
thinking, Tante? I was considering the
fact that our Sunrise Camp Fire at present
was smaller in number than I ever have
known it to be and that I am sorry.
Yvonne Fleury has returned to live with
her brother at the Ch&acirc;teau Yvonne, Gerry
is married and she and Felix in California,
and now Peggy is no longer with us.
Naturally, as she is planning to marry
after Christmas, she wishes to be with her
mother and father. Well, thank goodness
we shall have her for a visit at Christmas
time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s reply was so unexpected that there
was a short silence in the big room, broken
only by the crackling of the wood fire.</p>
<p>The loss of Peggy Webster as a member
of the Sunrise Camp Fire group was perhaps
more keenly felt than that of any
other girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The daughter of Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s twin sister,
Mollie O&rsquo;Neill, who afterwards became
Mrs. Daniel Webster, Peggy had been particularly
devoted to her aunt and, as Mrs.
Burton had no children of her own, was
more like her own daughter. Moreover,
Peggy and Bettina Graham, Sally and Alice
Ashton had been intimate friends since they
were tiny children, long before they had any
acquaintance with the later members of
their Camp Fire group. Peggy possessed a
singularly vital personality and was generous,
ardent and sweet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally, if you love me do not speak of
Peggy&rsquo;s absence or of her approaching
marriage. She is too absurdly young!
And yet I presume I must have given my
consent as Peggy declared she would not
marry without it, although she and Ralph
Merritt already feel they have waited a
long time. Sally, I feel as you do that
our Camp Fire circle is becoming too small.
Perhaps we shall grow too centered in one
another and not so helpful as we wish to be.
What would you suggest as a remedy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply, the other
girls as well as Sally Ashton pondering the
question.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I presume we ought to invite
other girls to join our Sunrise club,&rdquo; Sally
answered a moment later. And although
her reply was neither original nor startling,
it was received with unsympathetic silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the most unfortunate fashion,
Sally, of saying things other people would
prefer <i>not</i> to hear,&rdquo; Alice Ashton remarked
with sisterly severeness. Then, before any
one else had an opportunity to speak, the
living-room door opened and Mrs. Graham
and Bettina entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you have arrived at last, Betty,
we have been waiting tea for you and
Bettina. I was just about to send one of
the girls to find out what had become of
you. Vera has made a wonderful lot of
toast and we don&rsquo;t wish it to grow cold.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to have delayed you,&rdquo; Mrs.
Graham replied, &ldquo;but the most extraordinary
thing has occurred. I am glad to
find all of you gathered together here at
the same time. This morning the young
fellow, Allen Drain, who had dinner with
us, brought me a collection of his unpublished
poems which he wished to have me
read. They were in a black leather portfolio
about a foot square. When I drove
to Saranac this morning I left the portfolio
on a small table in Bettina&rsquo;s and my bedroom.
Since my return Bettina and I have
searched for more than an hour and can
find no sign of it. Did you, Polly, or any
of the girls take possession of it? I cannot
believe Aunt Patricia would be interested.
Some one of course must have moved it.
I don&rsquo;t mean to be cross, but I think I
should have been told. Bettina and I
have had an uncomfortable hour of searching.
Yet, whoever loved the poems better
than I shall be forgiven as soon as they are
restored to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no immediate reply, Mrs.
Burton, Aunt Patricia and the girls glancing
at one another, each expecting the
other to plead guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, confess, please, won&rsquo;t some one?
I am sure the poet would be flattered if he
learned what has occurred,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton
added. &ldquo;I am sorry, Betty. You should
have come at once and asked, rather than
tired yourself by searching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never a sign of the poet&rsquo;s manuscript
have I beheld!&rdquo; Alice Ashton returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am guiltless, Mrs. Graham, but why
did you not let me know so that I might
have helped you look?&rdquo; Marguerite Arnot
answered.</p>
<p>One by one each separate member of the
little circle announced an utter lack of
information with regard to the lost portfolio,
save Mary Gilchrist, who had gone
on with her reading after Bettina and her
mother&rsquo;s entrance into the living-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, I wonder if by any chance you
noticed the manuscript of the poems in
Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s room when I asked you to
find a magazine for me this morning?&rdquo;
Mrs. Burton inquired.</p>
<p>Mary Gilchrist glanced up from the pages
of her book, flushing slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t recall seeing the manuscript,
but really I cannot appreciate why Mrs.
Graham should be so concerned. I have
an idea the poems were of no value;
probably some one thought they were waste
paper and they were thrown into the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Gill, I don&rsquo;t believe you understand
the situation,&rdquo; Bettina Graham remonstrated.
&ldquo;Whether or not the poems were of
value they must represent years of work and
thought to Mr. Drain. I have no doubt
they mean more to him than we can well
imagine. Besides, the poems were entrusted
to mother&rsquo;s keeping and it would
be simply too dreadful if they could not be
found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shrugging her shoulders slightly, Mary
Gilchrist resumed her reading, while Mrs.
Graham sat down beside the Camp Fire
guardian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble, Betty dear, I am distressed
that you have been uneasy, but let&rsquo;s
have tea and then begin a more thorough
search of the entire house. The manuscript
of course is only tucked away somewhere
out of sight and will soon be found.
Poor young poet, nothing so tragic could
have happened as that his verse should be
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose, Polly, that by any
unlucky chance, if the portfolio is not discovered
the boy has no copies of his verses?
I scarcely dare face him unless the original
manuscript which he gave to me this morning
with such pride and pleasure, is restored.
I cannot even face the idea that the effort
of the boy&rsquo;s lifetime may be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, mother, drink your tea and
afterwards we will return to the search!
Nothing else has disappeared save the
manuscript, which would scarcely attract
an ordinary thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the poet himself returned mysteriously
and bore off his own handiwork,
unable to be so long without it,&rdquo; Mary
Gilchrist suggested. No one made a reply.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">&ldquo;A Man for a&rsquo; That.&rdquo;</span></span></h2>
<p>Several days later Mary Gilchrist
was again in the living-room in the
early afternoon, but on this occasion
she was alone.</p>
<p>At the piano in the corner of the room
she was practising a number of new Camp
Fire songs. During their shut-in winter in
the mountains, music promised to be one of
the principal relaxations, and, although not
so good a pianist as Bettina Graham, Gill
felt it her duty to regain a little of her lost
skill, due to the failure to work at her music
during the years spent abroad.</p>
<p>At present she was attempting a more
ambitious effort, trying to capture and
repeat the odd, musical notes that poured
forth so spontaneously from the youngest
of the Camp Fire girls. Meeting with
scant success, she was so intent upon her
effort that she was not aroused until the
living room door opened and an unexpected
guest entered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>As he did not glance in her direction, at
the same instant Mary Gilchrist slipped from
the piano stool and at once concealed herself
behind a tall fire screen that had been placed
near the wall. Her action was involuntary,
since she scarcely had time for thought;
nevertheless, once in her place of hiding,
deliberately Gill made up her mind to
remain where she was until she might escape
without detection.</p>
<p>The visitor who had come into the living-room
was Allan Drain.</p>
<p>They had not seen each other since their
original meeting and Gill wished for no
other. Not liking her present position,
yet it appeared impossible to make her
escape without being discovered and so
obliged to speak with him alone.</p>
<p>Between a tiny opening in the screen she
could behold a tall figure moving up and
down before the fire, and afterwards quietly
gazing into its depths. He looked older
than she recalled and yet Gill felt that
she disliked his appearance. The thin
figure seemed theatrical and self-conscious
and in a way effeminate, but then the type
of youth she admired had great physical
strength and courage, and Gill was convinced
that the present unconscious actor
was possessed of neither.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>She was aroused from her reflections by
a second opening of the door and the appearance
of Mrs. Graham in the same room.</p>
<p>Dressed in a simple, dark blue serge,
nevertheless she gave an effect of social
elegance and grace. A remarkably pretty
girl as Betty Ashton, as Mrs. Anthony
Graham, the wife of a distinguished United
States senator, her beauty and poise had
increased with added years and opportunities.</p>
<p>Her abundant auburn hair had the lovely
sheen which comes from careful attention,
there were a few lines about her eyes, but
except for these her skin was firm and clear
with a bright rose color in her cheeks, her
nose short and straight, her lips full and
deeply curved.</p>
<p>Not able to catch her expression as she
moved swiftly across the room and held out
her hand to their guest, Gill was able to
hear her first words and to wish that she
had faced the situation in the beginning
rather than place herself in her present position.
No one in their household would be
more vexed than Mrs. Graham to discover
her in hiding.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Brought up by her father on their large
wheat farm in the middle west, Mary Gilchrist
had lived an outdoor life, and without
a mother had been taught few of the
social amenities. During the years abroad,
her strength and endurance, her skill as a
motorist, her somewhat boyish abilities had
proved so useful that it had not occurred
to Mary Gilchrist until her return to the
United States that she was without the
social knowledge and education that girls
of her age and position should possess.
Before her visit home, during the few
weeks in New York City, she had been
conscious of her own awkwardness, particularly
appreciating the difference between
her own manners and Bettina Graham&rsquo;s.
For this reason, as well as others, she was
pleased over the Camp Fire&rsquo;s choice of the
Adirondack forest for their winter home.
In a wide, free, outdoor atmosphere she
would be once more at ease and undisturbed
by her want of social knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>Then, unexpectedly, Bettina&rsquo;s mother,
Mrs. Graham, had chosen to spend the
winter with them and from the first moment
of their introduction Gill had been able to
understand why Bettina Graham had acquired
a poise and graciousness no one of
the other Sunrise Camp Fire girls possessed.</p>
<p>Moreover, what Bettina had in slight
measure her mother possessed in fuller
degree. Indeed, not alone to Mary Gilchrist&rsquo;s
untrained judgment, but among
persons with the widest social acquaintance,
Betty Graham was famous for her charm
of manner and her gift for attracting men
and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to ask you to come to see me
to-day for a special reason, Mr. Drain.
But because I am sorrier than I can say I
am going to explain to you at once and
have the ordeal past. I shall not ask you
to forgive me, only to appreciate my regret.
Suppose we both sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instinctively disliking Allan Drain, yet
Mary Gilchrist realized that he also had a
gracious and cultivated manner when he
chose to employ it, as he did with Mrs.
Graham. From her vantage point, Gill
watched him draw a chair closer to the fire
and wait until Mrs. Graham was seated,
before seating himself near her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine why you should be
asking my pardon for a mistake or a fault,
but of course you know that I freely forgive
you. The apology should come from me.
I appreciated later that I ought not to have
thrust my poor verses upon you to bore you
and absorb your time when I knew you so
slightly. The truth is I am lonely this
winter and my scribbling means more to
me than it warrants. My family are not
in sympathy with my versifying or any of
my views of life. There are no women
among us, there is only my father, two older
brothers and myself. They have worked
very hard and are not prosperous and feel
I ought to be grateful to my uncle for
offering me the education they were not
able to have.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is all the more difficult for me
to tell you, Mr. Drain, that the manuscripts
of your poems which you entrusted to me
have by some extraordinary chance vanished.
I did not wish to tell you of this and
so for days I have made inquiries and every
member of our household has searched for
the verses. Now I cannot conceive of what
actually has become of them, and yet I am
afraid I am beginning to lose hope of their
being discovered. It is all the more mysterious
because we have no maids, no one
who could have thrown the papers away
from sheer carelessness and then be unwilling
to confess. Nevertheless, I do feel so
guilty and responsible, for if I had locked
the manuscript away instead of placing it
on a small table in my bed-room along with
some books and papers, this probably would
not have occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham leaned over and laid her
hand lightly upon her companion&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do reproach me, please do not look so
white and wretched. I know the loss of
your verses means many days of your time.
But if you will give me the privilege, in
order to show you have in a measure forgiven
me, I shall send for some one to come
to you and do the typewriting for you a
second time, or if you will permit Bettina
to copy the poems, I am sure she will do
her best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Graham, I have no other
copies of my poems, except three or four
which I have had the good luck to have
published in second-class magazines. Two
days before I brought my manuscript to
you I got them all into shape and burned
up and threw away the odd bits of paper
upon which they had been written. The
afternoon I met your daughter and her
friends in the woods I had gone for a
walk to celebrate the fact that my task
was accomplished. As I was thinking more
of my verses than the landmarks, I lost my
way. But please, please don&rsquo;t be so
unhappy on my account. The fault was
mine, not yours. I should not have troubled
you. You&rsquo;ll allow me to say good-by and
come to see you another day. No use
pretending, Mrs. Graham, that I am not
a good deal cut up and that I don&rsquo;t feel
that fate has been pretty hard. You are
sure that you have looked everywhere and
that the manuscript has not merely been
misplaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. But really I don&rsquo;t feel
that I can accept the idea that your verses
are lost forever. Surely you must recall
some of them, or will find stray copies here
and there!&rdquo; There were tears in Mrs.
Graham&rsquo;s voice as well as in her eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay any longer than you wish,
if it only makes things harder for you.
One would rather, I know, face disappointment
alone. And don&rsquo;t try to fight your
resentment, I shall feel better the angrier
you are with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Allan Drain and Mrs. Graham arose at
the same time, and Mary Gilchrist, scarcely
realizing what she was doing, half followed
their example, so that she was enabled to
see the two figures over the top of her
screen.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s back was turned to her,
but she could catch a glimpse of her companion&rsquo;s
face. He was painfully white,
yet his lips were firmly closed and his
expression showed less of the self pity
than she anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very brave, braver than I could
possibly be in your place,&rdquo; Mrs. Graham
murmured. &ldquo;If there was only something
I could do, some possible way to make up
to you I should not feel so unhappy. Yet
for the loss of creative work there is no
recompense.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but my work was not so valuable
as all that, Mrs. Graham, you are mistaken.
Most of my poetry was the veriest trash.
Editors and friends were of the same opinion.
Good-by, I will come in again in a
day or so, if you will allow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following instant the young man
was gone.</p>
<p>Startled and troubled by his swift departure,
making an unexpected movement
behind her screen, Gill beheld the screen
pitch forward and stood facing Mrs. Graham,
who had swung around at the unexpected
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been in hiding and listening
to what Mr. Drain and I were saying to
each other, one of the Sunrise Camp Fire
girls! I am afraid I do not understand.
There was nothing in our conversation you
might not have heard openly, had you cared
to join us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more surprise than reproach
in Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s manner and voice.</p>
<p>Blushing hotly, Mary Gilchrist felt unable
to offer a defense. What defense had
she to offer?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had no thought of listening, not at
first, Mrs. Graham. In order not to be
seen I hid myself for a moment and then
when you came into the room I did not
wish to interrupt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even to her own ears Gill did not feel that
her explanation really explained. Therefore
she could scarcely resent the slight
look of disdain on her companion&rsquo;s face,
as she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a child and under the circumstances
I think might have met the
situation in a less undignified fashion. As
Mrs. Burton is not well I shall not trouble
her by speaking of this because I am afraid
she would be a good deal displeased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first snow of the season was
falling.</p>
<p>Outside the night was transcendently
lovely, the hills covered with white
blankets, the trees, surprised at the first
winter breath, shaking crumpled leaves of
faded gold or bronze to be buried under
the snow. On the lake in front of Tahawus
cabin there was a light covering of ice,
making a bed for the snowflakes.</p>
<p>Overhead the moon shone down upon
the winter silence of the woods.</p>
<p>Inside the large cabin the Camp Fire girls
were seated about the fire in ceremonial
fashion, the Council meeting having just
ended. On the mantel the candles were
dying, although there was no other light in
the room save their flickering flames and
the light of the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, good-night, I&rsquo;ll leave you to your
final talk, not because I desire it, but
because I seem to be under orders,&rdquo; Mrs.
Burton protested, rising from her usual
position in the center of the circle.</p>
<p>A few feet away Mrs. Graham stood
waiting for her, and a moment later they
had disappeared arm in arm.</p>
<p>Afterwards there was a short silence
broken at last by Sally Ashton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why our own Camp Fire club
has never produced so devoted a friendship
as Tante and Aunt Betty have enjoyed so
many years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives,</p>
<p class="t0">And in their death they were not divided;</p>
<p class="t0">They were swifter than eagles,</p>
<p class="t0">They were stronger than lions.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive my quoting,&rdquo; Bettina Graham
murmured, &ldquo;but as we were to talk of
friendship to-night after our regular meeting,
those lines have been in my mind all
day. I like Vera&rsquo;s idea that we choose a
subject of conversation at our Camp Fire
meetings, once the actual business is over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>At this instant Vera Lageroff was glancing
out the window; purposely the blinds
had been left up so as not to shut out the
beauty of the night.</p>
<p>She turned now and looked from one girl
to the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true what Sally has just said?&rdquo; she
inquired. &ldquo;Have we no friendships in our
own Camp Fire circle as deep and ardent
and with the promise of continuing as Mrs.
Burton&rsquo;s and Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s has for so
many years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sally is always making amazing
speeches! I thought we were all extremely
fond of one another. In fact, Vera, perhaps
you and I have more things in common
because of our work together in France.
I don&rsquo;t believe I shall ever be so content
anywhere else,&rdquo; Alice Ashton remonstrated.</p>
<p>At one of the outermost ends of the semicircle,
close up to the fire, Sally was seated.
At this moment she wore a frown between
her level brows, but not because she objected
to her sister&rsquo;s statement, which she
scarcely had heard, but because she was
pursuing her own idea and her mind did
not work swiftly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course I know we are friends after
a fashion,&rdquo; Sally returned, &ldquo;but I suppose
I was thinking of the David and Jonathan
kind of friendship, something big and wonderful
and everlasting. I know I have
never had anything approaching a great
intimacy with any one of you girls in the
years we have been together in our Camp
Fire club. Gerry and I were extremely
friendly, nothing more. After she married
Felix we soon ceased even writing to each
other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment Sally leaned her chin in her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In spite of our Sunrise Camp Fire, I
believe I have been more intimate with
Dan Webster, and he has been a closer,
warmer friend to me than any one of you
girls. Yet I have not seen much of him
since I was a small girl, save the summer
in California and for a little while in Paris
after the close of the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I should not care to make
such a confession, Sally Ashton. Our Camp
Fire organization was created partly to
teach us the value of friendship among
girls, and not only friendship but the
ability to live together and work together.
I consider we have accomplished this with
enough success to be proud,&rdquo; Alice Ashton
argued.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>The silence was half thoughtful, half
antagonistic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I by no means agree with Sally. However,
I can speak only for myself,&rdquo; Bettina
Graham interposed. &ldquo;The friendships I have
had in our Camp Fire club are the deepest
in my life. I hardly dare allow myself to
think of Peggy Webster&rsquo;s marriage, which
is not many months away. Besides, I do
not wish to be personal, I suppose none of
us do, yet, in spite of Sally&rsquo;s unfaith, I am
sure there are other intimate friendships
among us. Moreover, what our ideal really
should be, is not what Sally suggests, beautiful
and inspiring as the story of David
and Jonathan. Our intimacy should extend
through all our Camp Fire club and we
should care for one another almost equally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the wide semi-circle, one of the girls
had been unusually silent during the evening,
indeed had never spoken unless a
question were directly addressed to her.</p>
<p>At this instant she looked closely at Bettina
Graham with a peculiar expression in
which there was appeal and defiance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are an idealist, Bettina, and the
type of idealist who demands the impossible.
Human beings can not care for one another
in the same degree. It is against the law
of nature itself. We can be loyal and
interested in every member of our Camp
Fire group, yet we cannot care for each
one alike. You yourself are unable to, for
no one has taken Peggy Webster&rsquo;s place
with you, and perhaps no one of us ever
shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half shyly the girls glanced from one to
the other when Mary Gilchrist had ceased
speaking. Gill dropped her eyes so that
their gaze appeared concentrated upon her
hands which she held folded together in
her lap.</p>
<p>The fact that Gill for many months had
made every effort to fill Peggy&rsquo;s place in
Bettina&rsquo;s friendship was well known to
every one of the other girls, except perchance
to Bettina herself. Yet if at first Bettina
had seemed to welcome the other girl&rsquo;s
admiration and in a measure to return her
affection, of late she had kept apart from her
as much as possible. Bettina was not
unkind, only her manner was cold and
reserved. More openly Mrs. Graham betrayed
less liking for Mary Gilchrist than
any one of the group of Camp Fire girls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>However, as Marguerite Arnot had come
from Paris to live for a time with Mrs.
Graham and Bettina, it was but natural
that at present they should show a special
interest in her.</p>
<p>At this moment, as Bettina made no
reply to Mary Gilchrist&rsquo;s implied invitation,
Sally interposed with characteristic
coolness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I appreciate that I always have
been more of an outsider than any other
member of our Sunrise Camp Fire. Don&rsquo;t
think I am complaining; I realize that I
am colder or more selfish and that I have
fewer intimacies. But, Vera,&rdquo; Sally&rsquo;s large
golden brown eyes caught those of the
other girl, who plainly had been thinking
of something else, &ldquo;Vera, to-night, during
our discussion of friendship, are you thinking
of one of us, or of Billy Webster? Was
he not more truly your friend than any
member of our Camp Fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally!&rdquo; came the shocked exclamation
from several of the girls at the same instant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>However, Vera Lagerloff&rsquo;s long eyes, with
their odd foreign look, met Sally&rsquo;s bravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why Sally should not
speak of Billy Webster. Please do not
think I ever forget him. Yes, Sally, Billy
was the best friend I ever had or hope to
have. Yet his death in California<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> has not
left me less ready to give my friendship to
our Camp Fire. Indeed, I sometimes feel
it is only through the Camp Fire and our
work in France that I have been able to
accept Billy&rsquo;s passing away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He that loseth his life shall gain it,&rsquo;&rdquo;
Bettina quoted softly.</p>
<p>In the midst of the pause, feeling that
her introduction of Billy Webster&rsquo;s memory
had made their discussion of friendship
more sorrowful than she had intended, and
conscious that Alice and Bettina were
frowning upon her with varying degrees
of severity, Sally turned her gaze from the
firefight and her group of friends.</p>
<p>At the instant her attention was attracted
by a whirr of snow against the window. It
was as if an errant gust of wind had tossed
great handfuls against the pane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>There was a noise outside, a little scuffling,
uncertain noise.</p>
<p>Sally looked more closely, and as she
looked her eyes widened and her red lips
parted. The color faded slowly from her
fire-warmed cheeks.</p>
<p>The next instant she was on her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a face outside the window,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;And one I have seen before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later the big living-room
in the winter cabin at Half Moon Lake was
deserted, the discussion on friendship having
ended abruptly before it was well begun.</p>
<p>On the mantel the candles representing
work, health and love had ceased to glow.
There were only a few sparks left to
smoulder amid the ashes of the log fire.</p>
<p>No one of the other girls had seen a
vision at the window save Sally Ashton,
and therefore believed that she had been
mistaken. Some animal may have wandered
out of the deep woods because of the
storm and been attracted by the lights
inside the cabin.</p>
<p>Yet the spell was broken and bed appeared
the happiest solution.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Midwinter</span></span></h2>
<p>To the Sunrise Camp Fire girls the
closing in of winter about Tahawus
cabin brought a new experience of
life. Never in the many seasons spent
together under varying conditions had they
been so thrown upon their own resources
for happiness and growth!</p>
<p>Of the outside world of companionship
and stimulation, they had no one and
nothing upon which they might depend,
and this following two eventful years in
Europe during the close and in the months
after the great war.</p>
<p>Yet they had been told what they must
expect, the quiet, the loneliness, the shut-in-ness
of their existence.</p>
<p>Discovering that her health made it
unwise to attempt returning to the stage
during the winter, Mrs. Burton anticipated
spending the winter alone in the Adirondacks
save for occasional visits from her
husband and Aunt Patricia, her sister and
possibly her friend, Betty Graham.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>However, Miss Patricia Lord had been
first to decry an arrangement of this character,
protesting that since Polly O&rsquo;Neill
Burton appeared unable to look after herself
when she was <i>not</i> ill, what could one
expect of her under other conditions! Personally
she had no idea of permitting her
to make further trouble for her husband
and friends. This was of course Miss
Patricia&rsquo;s fashion of confessing that nothing
could separate her from the individual
she loved best in the world, so long as her
care, devotion and wealth could be of
service.</p>
<p>Without Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s knowledge Captain
Burton and Miss Patricia made a
journey to the Adirondacks, where they
secured the lease of Tahawus cabin for a
year with the privilege of a longer term,
and here, a few weeks later, Mrs. Burton
found herself established under Miss Patricia&rsquo;s
guardianship, her husband being forced
to return to his work in Washington.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The maid who accompanied them Miss
Patricia soon dismissed, announcing that
she gave more trouble than assistance.
And, although regretting her loss, seeing
that the girl herself was lonely and unhappy
and unable to live in peace with Miss
Patricia, Mrs. Burton felt obliged to consent.
Later she made a number of efforts
to secure another maid (Marie, who had
lived with her so many years, having been
left behind in France), but up to the present
time no one had been discovered agreeable
to Miss Patricia.</p>
<p>Annoyed and unhappy over the amount
of work Miss Patricia insisted upon undertaking,
Mrs. Burton found her protests
and efforts toward aid both set aside.
Moreover, as rest was essential to her
recovery, she dared not undertake heavy
tasks.</p>
<p>During the latter part of the summer and
the early fall, therefore, she and Miss
Patricia lived alone at the cabin, although
for various reasons neither of them particularly
content.</p>
<p>Miss Patricia&rsquo;s anxiety revealed itself in
an increasing sternness and solicitude which
left her charge small opportunity for peace.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton, who was not seriously ill so
long as she was resting and in a proper environment,
oftentimes found herself lonely
and restless, and ashamed of her discontent.</p>
<p>She was surrounded with every comfort
and a good deal of luxury. Her room,
twenty feet square, had four large windows
facing the south and west; the plastered
walls were painted a pale yellow with curtains
of a deeper shade. Upholstered in yellow
silk with half a dozen yellow and brown
silk curtains, was the couch Miss Patricia
had ordered from New York to be in keeping
with the room. Supplies of magazines and
books were sent weekly from town, letters
arrived in generous number, occasionally a
visitor appeared from one of the hotels or
cottages a few miles off, but oftentimes was
sent away unseen by Mrs. Burton, Aunt
Patricia concluding that she were better
left alone if the visitor happened to be not
a friend but an acquaintance merely desiring
to do homage to a famous woman.</p>
<p>Fortunately Miss Patricia looked with
favor upon the physician who made weekly
calls upon his patient. Miss Lord had
secured a cabin in this particular neighborhood
in order that the younger woman
might be under his care.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>One afternoon during the first week in
September, Miss Patricia and Mrs. Burton
were sitting in her bed-room between five
and six o&rsquo;clock. The twilight was beginning
to close gently in so that a single lamp was
lighted on a table which stood near Mrs.
Burton&rsquo;s couch. Lying upon the couch,
she was holding a newspaper open in her
hand, but at the moment was not reading.</p>
<p>A few feet away Miss Patricia sat grimly
hemming dish towels.</p>
<p>Neither had spoken in the last ten minutes,
not since Dr. Larimer, after an hour&rsquo;s
visit, had driven away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an extremely entertaining companion,
Polly. Do you realize you scarcely
have spoken to me all day, and yet you
seemed to find a great deal to discuss with
Dr. Larimer; perhaps because he is a man
and I am only a woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swiftly Mrs. Burton dropped the paper
which had been hiding her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry, dear, to have been so
stupid; I have been reading since Dr.
Larimer&rsquo;s visit. But it is unkind of you
to say I preferred talking to Dr. Larimer
for such a reason, when you know what I
wanted to discuss with him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and his answer was exactly what
I anticipated,&rdquo; Miss Patricia answered
severely, although her eyes were now searching
the younger woman&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Polly, I
desire you to be truthful, even when the
truth appears less complimentary to me.
In the last few minutes you have not read
a single line. I have been watching you
and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper slid to the floor as Mrs. Burton
sat up clasping her arms about her knees.
Her corded yellow silk gown with a soft fall
of lace about her throat had been put on in
honor of the doctor&rsquo;s call; her black hair
was loosely coiled on top of her head, her
cheeks too brightly flushed, her blue eyes
less clear than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and sit beside me, Aunt Patricia,
please do as I want to make a confession.
It is true I have not been reading these last
few minutes because a few moments ago
I read the announcement of a brilliant new
play produced in New York City last week
and I was envious and rebellious. Of course
I really expected to have Dr. Larimer
declare that I must remain all winter in
the mountains and yet I must have hoped
he would allow me to return to town after
a few more months. I am sorry of course,
but really, Aunt Patricia, you must not
bury yourself here with me, when I am
such a burden besides being a stupid companion.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Polly, if you can
avoid it,&rdquo; was Miss Patricia&rsquo;s reply. Yet
she came and seated herself on the couch
beside the younger woman, and by and by
her arm was about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my child,&rdquo; she announced a
few moments later, &ldquo;the truth is, I am
neither lonely nor dissatisfied, but <i>you</i> are.
I am never unhappy when I am with you.
However, that is neither here nor there.
Naturally you need other companionship
than an excessively disagreeable old woman.
Your husband cannot be with you this
winter, his work makes it impossible. I
have been thinking for several days of an
idea which I discussed with the doctor this
afternoon after his conversation with you.
Why not have your own Camp Fire girls
to spend the winter at the cabin with you?
You are accustomed to them and they would
keep you interested and able to give less
time to thinking of yourself. Dr. Larimer
has no objection; says you will grow stronger
as soon as you are in a more cheerful frame
of mind. Would you like to have the girls,
dear, because if so, in the last ten moments
before I reproached you for not speaking,
I had been planning a letter to each one of
the girls which I shall write to-night, once
you are asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid they won&rsquo;t care to join us
here, Aunt Patricia. The winter will be so
long and cold and at present the Camp
Fire girls are in their own homes. You
must not on my account ask them to come
to us; we shall be happy alone, except now
and then when I am especially tiresome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, at the mere suggestion Mrs.
Burton&rsquo;s face had flushed, her eyes were
no longer clouded and a bit of her old
animation had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our invitation to the Sunrise Camp Fire
girls shall not imply a favor to us should
they care to accept. I shall also tell them
what they are to expect,&rdquo; Miss Patricia
added. &ldquo;If they elect to spend a winter
in the Adirondack forest, it will be of
benefit to their health as well as to yours.
Moreover, do not believe that I am issuing
this invitation solely on your account, Polly.
More than I dreamed possible I am missing
the Camp Fire girls myself, particularly
Vera and Alice, who are more sensible than
the others.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>Later in the same evening, while Mrs.
Burton lay half asleep on her couch, seated
not far away Miss Patricia Lord wrote her
letters of invitation. She kept her word;
the letters mentioned the conditions the
girls would be forced to meet, the long cold,
the quiet days and nights and the fact that
they could count on but little society or
entertainment save what they could create
among themselves. However, the cabin
was comfortable and the surroundings beautiful.
In only one line did Miss Patricia
betray the fact that she believed their Camp
Fire guardian&rsquo;s health might be improved
by the companionship of the group of girls
who had meant so much to her in the past
years.</p>
<p>Yet it may have been this line that represented
the necessary influence, or merely
that the girls enjoyed the novelty of a
winter in the North woods.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>Whatever the reason, October found them
living together in their accustomed fashion
and now October had passed and November
and it was the first week of December.</p>
<p>So far, according to the woodsmen, the
winter had been a remarkably open one.</p>
<p>One Friday afternoon, soon after luncheon,
Mary Gilchrist came out of the cabin
alone. A short time before Mrs. Burton,
Mrs. Graham and Marguerite Arnot had
gone for a drive, the rough little pony they
had been using earlier in the season was
now transferred from the carriage to a
sleigh.</p>
<p>Ordinarily the Camp Fire guardian preferred
the girls not to go any distance away
from Tahawus cabin alone. So, as she had
found it difficult to secure a companion,
Gill had no thought of being outdoors more
than an hour. Fresh air and exercise were
essential to her health and happiness.</p>
<p>Sally, who first had been asked to accompany
her, disliking the cold and none too
fond of exercise, had pleaded the fact that
she was busily engaged in preparing mincemeat
for the approaching Christmas holidays
and desired to go on with her task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Bettina Graham, Gill preferred not to
invite, believing that Bettina would surely
decline. Alice Ashton and Vera were at
work on their Christmas sewing and had
a walk of several miles earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Promising Sally to bring back any winter
berries or evergreens she might discover, at
three o&rsquo;clock Gill set forth alone. She was
dressed in a short skirt and a gray fur coat
and cap and was wearing snowshoes.</p>
<p>No snow had fallen for the past week and
there was a hard layer of ice. The afternoon
was cloudless and brilliant, the sky
above the tree tops ravishingly blue.</p>
<p>A number of paths led away from the
door of the cabin and Gill started along one
which came down to the edge of the lake.
As the lake was frozen over, she followed
the line of the west shore for about half a
mile, gliding along on the ice, her cheeks
tingling, her eyes sparkling with the delight
of the exercise and the exhilaration of the
winter air. Not in some time had she felt
so serene. These past few weeks for several
reasons had been as uncomfortable ones as
she ever cared to live through. Fortunately
she always had believed in the value of an
outdoor life to bring one to more cheerful
views, even before her membership in the
Camp Fire had emphasized this truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>Tiring of the smooth surface of the lake,
at length Gill climbed a snowdrift to enter
a balsam forest which seemed to cover only
a small area before it opened into a clearing
beyond.</p>
<p>At no great distance from their own cabin,
Gill had no recollection at the moment of
this particular woods, perhaps because the
winter afternoon gave it a new and strange
aspect.</p>
<p>She recognized that the trees were white
pine, many of them fifty feet in height
with drooping long branches and five-fingered
leaf bunches. Beneath the trees
the ground, soft with the needles at other
seasons, was to-day hard and white as a
marble bed.</p>
<p>The arch of the trees formed a kind
of natural temple with the opening beyond
like a great rose window seen through the
intervening space.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>As she approached the end of the vista
Gill heard a noise which at first startled
and later on puzzled and troubled her.
The noise was like the barking of a dog in
distress. She stood still, called and whistled
only to have the sound cease and then
begin again with a deeper note of suffering.</p>
<p>Continuing her walk, but more slowly,
Gill moved in the direction from which the
barking came. In spite of what may have
appeared to contradict this fact, actually
she was more attached to animals than any
one of the Camp Fire girls. Within another
moment she had made a discovery. In a
trap set by a hunter a small red fox had
been caught but not killed. The barking
to her ears had sounded like a dog&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding its pain and terror and
fear of human beings, it seemed to Gill the
little animal turned its red-brown eyes
toward her with an expression of appeal.</p>
<p>Several seconds the girl stood frowning
and puzzled, all her color flown and her
lips trembling. Her own ignorance and
cowardice formed the chief barrier. The
little animal&rsquo;s hind feet had been caught
and nearly torn from the body, and yet she
was unable to open the trap or to relieve
the pain in any way, as she carried no
weapon of any kind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>Gill set her teeth. Why not walk on or,
a better plan, return to the warmth and
friendliness of the big cabin. Of a sudden
she felt lonely and vaguely uneasy here in
the silent woods, the silence broken only
by the cry of a small animal in pain. Yet
the pain could not continue indefinitely,
and in any event she could soon be out of
sight and hearing.</p>
<p>Gill&rsquo;s eyes dropped toward the ground.
Immediately in her path she beheld a heavy
stick, from which the snow had blown away,
leaving it exposed to her gaze. A second
only she hesitated, then picking it up discovered
that the end was round and thick
as a bludgeon. She knew that her eye and
her aim were unswerving, yet the prospect
of a moment&rsquo;s swift action made her sick
and faint.</p>
<p>The next Gill lifted her cudgel. With a
quick stroke between the eyes that were
fastened half fearfully, half trustfully upon
her own, the little creature&rsquo;s suffering was
ended.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Afterwards, absurd as it seemed to her,
Gill could not walk on at once. Instead
she leaned against a nearby tree, closing
her eyes to avoid the spectacle before her.
She could hunt without especial emotion or
regret, when her aim was steady and there
was no suggestion of long pain or suffering
afterwards. But to kill, as she had felt
herself forced to do in the last few moments,
had upset her in the most acute fashion.</p>
<p>Gill opened her eyes when she heard some
one coming toward her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to appear only when I am in
the act of taking a life, Mr. Drain,&rdquo; she
exclaimed with poorly concealed bitterness,
allowing her state of mind to find expression
in the tone of her voice. &ldquo;I am sorry to
have you a witness to what I have just done
and yet I felt it was unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have only accomplished what I
have been trying to find courage to do this
last half hour, Miss Gilchrist. But you do
look used up. My little cabin is not an
eighth of a mile away, won&rsquo;t you come in
and rest for a moment? I am sure your
friends will not object. I am fairly intimate
with most of them except you. Somehow
we never seem to meet when I am at
Tahawus cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">The Poet&rsquo;s Corner</span></span></h2>
<p>The little pine house had only two
rooms, one a small bed-room, the
other serving as kitchen, dining-room
and living-room. As there was no
furnace and a wood fire would afford insufficient
heat, an old-fashioned stove extended
its stove pipe up the fireplace chimney.</p>
<p>This stove, packed tight with small
chunks of wood, was now red hot and on
top a kettle was pouring forth a thin stream
of steam.</p>
<p>Allan Drain kneeled down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll allow me to take off your snowshoes
so you can be more comfortable?
I envy you your skill in being able to
manage them as I have been struggling
for several weeks without success. Please
don&rsquo;t mind the small amount of snow you
have brought into the room. I am not
a particular housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill glanced about the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure. It seems to me you
have arranged your room in a satisfactory
and at the same time a picturesque fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my belongings are few and simple
after the grandeur of your cabin. I only
brought a bed and a table and a chair and
some books along with me. Since, I have
been lucky enough to get hold of a few
possessions left behind in the North woods
by fellows who once were in pretty much
the same fix I am. I have made the rest
of the furniture myself from the wood I
bought at a lumber camp not far off. See
that book shelf to the left of the mantle; it
was given me by a backwoods preacher,
an old man who says it once belonged
to Robert Louis Stevenson. You know
Stevenson spent a winter in the Adirondacks
for his health, don&rsquo;t you? He and
my old woodsman, who was a young fellow
then, became friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill nodded, but not so impressed as her
companion had expected and hoped.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard Mrs. Burton and Bettina
Graham talking of the famous men and
women who have lived in the Adirondack
forests. Besides Stevenson there was a
&lsquo;Philosopher&rsquo;s Camp&rsquo; with Emerson and
James Russell Lowell and Professor Agassiz
as members. Perhaps they may be an
inspiration to you, but I cannot say I feel
any deep interest. I told you I was not
in the least literary and that I cared for
the outdoors and not for books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not she intended this, there
was a slightly contemptuous note in the
girl&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Her companion, having removed her
snowshoes, rose quickly with his face
slightly flushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a cup of tea with me. The
water is boiling so I can have it ready in
a few minutes. It will warm you after
your walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Gill nodded acquiescence, quickly and
deftly as a girl Allan Drain set about his
preparations.</p>
<p>His tea service consisted of a brown
earthenware teapot, two cups and saucers,
a cheap little pitcher and a silver sugar
bowl of rare beauty, evidently an heirloom.</p>
<p>He had placed on the table a pot of gooseberry
jam and now undertook to make the
toast by opening his stove door and toasting
the bread at the end of a long fork.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Offering no assistance, Gill sat watching,
glancing sometimes at her host and as often
at his surroundings.</p>
<p>Truly he had revealed ingenuity and taste
in his arrangements, in spite of the scarcity
and poverty of his furnishings. In the first
place, the room was clean, the floor swept,
the books and furniture dusted. On the
walls were several unframed sketches and
photographs made by amateur artists, pictures
of the North woods in summer or
autumn beauty. Fastened alongside were
the skins of a raccoon and a beaver; on the
floor, although somewhat the worse for
wear, a large bearskin rug. There were
two chairs and a table of crude but not
ugly workmanship. Gill discovered herself
enthroned in the solitary chair her host
had brought with him for his lonely winter
in the forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would have preferred
to be at a hotel or a hospital for the winter
if you are not well,&rdquo; she volunteered a few
moments later when her host had placed
her chair in front of one of his tables where
his little feast was spread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>In spite of the fact that she was enjoying
her tea, Gill found conversation difficult
with an individual whose tastes and point
of view were so unlike her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think you would be desperately
lonely here; you see it is different with us,
there are so many of us and we are accustomed
to being together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Allan Drain lifted the teapot his long,
slender hand shook slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I am often lonely,&rdquo; he agreed.
&ldquo;It would be absurd for me to deny it. I
live in this fashion rather than in a hotel
or boarding house because it is much
cheaper. My people have no money to
spare and the uncle who has been paying
for my education as a surgeon is annoyed
at my break-down. He declares that if I
were less antagonistic to my work I would
never have gone to pieces. In fact, he
thinks I am enjoying myself living alone
in the woods with an opportunity to write
poetry and dream, which is all he believes
I care for, and he is not so far from right.
I know you will have a contempt for me,
but I tried my best to make up my mind
to do what you managed to accomplish
in a few seconds, relieve a little animal from
pain. If I had not the nerve or the courage
to be of help to an animal, what do
you think of my chance of being of service
to human beings?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will be of <i>any use</i> at
all,&rdquo; Gill answered abruptly, and then it
was her turn to flush, not because it troubled
her that she may have wounded her companion,
but because she had been uncomfortably
conscious of the abruptness and
awkwardness of her manner ever since her
interview with Mrs. Graham. This was
only a fresh instance of her lack of poise
and tact, which seemed so conspicuous in
Mrs. Graham and Bettina and which she
so admired.</p>
<p>In spite of his courtesy and kindness at
the present time, Gill was still convinced
that she did not like Allan Drain and could
never like him under any circumstances.
The antagonism of their first meeting was
only asleep and might wake again at any
moment. Surely he must like her even less
and with better reason. This afternoon he
was only returning the hospitality he had
received from other members of her own
Camp Fire group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>When her host arose to replenish the fire
Gill studied him closely. She was again
positive that she did not care for his appearance.
The yellow hair bronzed by the sun
until it was nearly the color of a lion&rsquo;s mane
was worn too long, the figure was too slender
and without sufficient force, the broad
shoulders stooped. Yet perhaps he was
not so effeminate in appearance as she
originally had thought; the effect was rather
due to delicacy.</p>
<p>Selfishly Gill uttered an inward breath of
thankfulness, grateful for her own perfect
health. Never had she felt more vigorous
than to-day. Already she was growing
tired of the little room and her host and
anxious to return home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sure you must find a great
deal to keep you busy. Thank you for
asking me to see your house. I must say
good-by now and hurry back to the cabin.
I am afraid it is growing late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Insisting on adjusting her own snowshoes,
Gill stood at the door of the cabin
with her back to the wall, smiling her
farewell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>If her opinion of Allan Drain had not
altered, his impression of her had slightly
changed. This afternoon he did not so
much dislike her half boyish appearance,
the bobbed hair of a bright auburn color,
the short nose and wide mouth with the
white, firm teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have you go. I would walk
back with you to Tahawus cabin with
pleasure, but as I cannot manage my snowshoes
without half a dozen headers I should
only bore and delay you. Mrs. Graham
and Mrs. Burton have been good enough
to say I may come and share in your Christmas
festivities. You are expecting many
guests, aren&rsquo;t you? The time is not far off
and I shall try to keep so busy with my
writing that the days will fly until then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that you are re-writing
the verses that were lost at our cabin? I
suppose they will be all the better for the
added work,&rdquo; Gill said hastily and in a tone
of relief.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, not the poor old verses over
again!&rdquo; her companion returned. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
the courage, besides the fates must have
known they were of no value and spared
me the task of making away with them.
I know it is ridiculous of me, but actually
I am attempting to write a play. Mrs.
Burton suggested the idea when we were
talking together, although she is unaware
of the fact. I know it will amount to
nothing, so please keep my secret. I don&rsquo;t
know why I should have mentioned it to
you, except that I have not seen another
human being for two days. Well, good-by
if you must go, and thank you for your
visit. My best wishes to Tahawus cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Holiday Guests</span></span></h2>
<p>Arrangements at Tahawus cabin
were to be readjusted to meet the
approach of Christmas guests, especially
as the household was a strictly
feminine one and a number of the guests
were masculine.</p>
<p>Captain Burton would come up from
Washington city to be with his wife for a
few days, if not the entire length of the
holiday.</p>
<p>Dan Webster with his mother and sister,
Peggy, intended spending several weeks.
Mrs. Webster had been unable to see her
sister except for a few days since her return
from Europe. Peggy Webster desired a
rest and a farewell holiday with her group
of Camp Fire girls before her marriage to
Ralph Merritt. Therefore Ralph was to be
a few days at the cabin but was not to
remain the entire length of Peggy&rsquo;s stay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>A third visitor, who had not the excuse
of family relationship, was David Hale, a
young American whom the Camp Fire girls
met originally in France during the days of
the Peace Conference.<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>At that time he had been an especial
friend of Bettina Graham&rsquo;s and of the
French girl, Marguerite Arnot, but later
on both girls had lost sight of him, since
Bettina only answered his letters occasionally
and he had never written Marguerite.</p>
<p>However, he had returned to the United
States with the closing of his work as
secretary to a prominent member of the
Peace Council and since had lived in
Washington city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Through a note of introduction from
Bettina he had met her mother and father,
and he and Mrs. Graham had become fast
friends. Indeed, for a number of years
Betty Graham had held a small court of
young men about her in Washington, to
whom she represented their ideal of what
a gracious and beautiful woman should be.
The situation always had amused her
husband and friends, and Bettina openly
declared that she cherished not the faintest
hope of becoming her mother&rsquo;s rival. As
a matter of fact, she was not especially
popular. So she was scarcely surprised,
and not in the least annoyed, upon arriving
at the conclusion that her mother had
supplanted her in David Hale&rsquo;s friendship.
True, she had liked him in France, where
they seemed to have many points of congeniality!
But some little time had passed
since then and other interests had interfered
with her original impression. Nevertheless,
she was glad to accept her mother&rsquo;s suggestion
that they ask David Hale to make
one of their Christmas house party. The
other girls had liked him, Miss Patricia
had treated him with marked favor, and
there was little doubt that he would add
to everybody&rsquo;s pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Now and then Bettina had wondered if
Marguerite Arnot were homesick or regretted
leaving her own country for the United
States. True, she had said nothing to
suggest this, yet she was as reserved as
Bettina herself! Moreover, so far she had
not in any way been thrown upon her own
resources, part of her time in America she
had spent with her mother and herself
and the rest with Miss Patricia Lord.
After the Camp Fire winter was over her
future was less assured unless she should
choose to remain in Washington city with
them. Undoubtedly Marguerite had proved
extremely useful to her mother with her
pretty, quiet manner and her gift for sewing.
Yet her position in their household
had been a little difficult, due more to
Marguerite&rsquo;s shyness and her refusal to
take part in the social life of Washington
as their friend, which was the position she
and her mother both wished Marguerite
to accept.</p>
<p>So Bettina, recalling the fact that Marguerite
Arnot had in her quiet fashion
displayed pleasure in David Hale&rsquo;s acquaintance,
regarded this as another reason to be
pleased with his appearance at the Christmas
house party. During the weeks she
and Marguerite were in Washington city,
they had been able to see David Hale only
once, as he chanced to be west at the time
on official business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>Never before had Bettina thought of
herself in the light of a matchmaker, so,
secretly, she was amused by her present
point of view. Marguerite Arnot and
David Hale were her friends and one
always possessed the right to wish happiness
for one&rsquo;s friends. Now the Adirondack
woods in their winter cloak were like fairyland,
so wonderful that Bettina, had she
not been sure she was proof against romance,
must have felt their romantic influence.
She did feel their inspiration and their
beauty every hour of the day. But Bettina
had arranged a future for herself in which
an ordinary romance played no part, and
by ordinary romance she meant the eternal
romance of youth.</p>
<p>Dr. and Mrs. Ashton, Alice&rsquo;s and Sally&rsquo;s
parents, were to arrive from Boston, bringing
with them a distant cousin, a youth of
about nineteen or twenty whom neither
girl had seen in a number of years.</p>
<p>One change in their household arrangements
upon which the Camp Fire guardian
and Mrs. Graham both insisted was that
during the holiday season some one be
secured to assist with the domestic work,
else with so many additional people to be
cared for, the girls would be worn out and
have little time for pleasure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton had another reason which
she did not choose to make public. She
dreaded the added strain upon Miss Patricia,
who in spite of her wonderful vigor and
energy would doubtless wear herself to the
breaking point and be extremely difficult
in consequence. At the close of her reconstruction
work in France to which she had
devoted herself she had reached England in
a state of nervous and physical exhaustion.
However, after a few weeks of travel and
rest she had entirely recovered. Notwithstanding,
Mrs. Burton could not refrain
from worrying over Miss Patricia&rsquo;s unfailing
care of her, in which she seemed unwilling
to allow any one else to share. Any
human being with less tact than Mrs.
Graham would long since have met with
Miss Patricia&rsquo;s disapproval. She did manage,
however, to spend several hours each
day with her friend without incurring Miss
Patricia&rsquo;s anger, and in small ways, never
in more important ones, to relieve the older
woman&rsquo;s constant vigilance. As a matter
of fact, Betty Graham was a decided
favorite with Aunt Patricia and had been
for a number of years. Many times she
was heard to announce that she wished
Polly Burton were possessed of an equal
amount of sweetness and good judgment.
Moreover, Miss Patricia really recognized
the claim of the friendship older than her
own, and although now and then suffering
twinges of jealousy, usually kept them to
herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Yet even Aunt Patricia had not protested
against the instalment of some one
to help with the Christmas festivities,
provided a suitable person could be discovered.
And the good fortune in the
situation was that Miss Patricia made the
discovery herself.</p>
<p>David Murray, who helped with the
outside work and cared for the furnace,
was an old bachelor living in a small cabin
a mile or more away and yet the closest
neighbor to the Camp Fire girls.</p>
<p>Old David was as much of a character
in his way as Miss Patricia in hers, disliking
the feminine sex with greater intensity than
Miss Patricia bestowed upon his, as Miss
Patricia&rsquo;s dislike of men never had been
satisfactorily proven save by her spinsterhood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Some time before David had confided
to Miss Patricia that a letter from his half
sister, Elspeth, had informed him of the
fact that she was tired of &ldquo;working out&rdquo;
and was coming to live with him. He did
not wish her society and had stated the
fact plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet knowin&rsquo; the ways of women, Miss
Patricia, if she has made up her mind to
it, she&rsquo;ll come. She knows a man can&rsquo;t
set a woman outside his door to freeze
weather like this even if he has a mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks later with all her possessions
Elspeth arrived and finding her brother
away, had pushed open the door. There
she was upon his return making herself
thoroughly at home.</p>
<p>However, the cottage was small and
David was &ldquo;dour&rdquo;, so Elspeth was soon
willing to make friends with the Camp Fire
girls and to agree to come and live with
them at Christmas time. She and Miss
Patricia were even a little alike, since one
was of Scotch descent and the other Irish.
Miss Patricia promised to leave the cooking
and housekeeping to Elspeth and the Camp
Fire girls, so long as nothing interfered with
her care of Mrs. Burton, which, after all, consisted
largely in seeing that she ate and slept
more than she wished and was in the fresh
air whenever it was possible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton had pleaded for a little more
freedom during the holidays and had her
request denied with the threat that the
house party itself should be abandoned
unless she agreed to follow her usual
r&eacute;gime.</p>
<p>So the big cabin before the arrival of the
Christmas guests was filled with the odors
of cooking and cleaning and the smell of
evergreens.</p>
<p>The arrangement was that the married
people and Camp Fire girls should live in
the big house and the smallest of the cabins
and the other be devoted to Dan Webster,
David Hale, and Philip Stead, the unknown
cousin of Alice and Sally Ashton.</p>
<p>Mrs. Graham had suggested that Allan
Drain be invited to spend a few days at
the cabin rather than be forced to return
to his own home when he was sharing their
amusements. But as no one had met the
proposal with any enthusiasm she had said
nothing more. Her own desire was to make
up to the young fellow in any possible way
for the loss for which she felt increasingly
responsible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Captain Burton was to arrive before any
other member of the house party. Instead
of trusting to an automobile or a sleigh that
might be had at Saranac, the nearest village,
old David drove over to meet his train, due
at about five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>At six o&rsquo;clock every light in Tahawus
cabin was burning brightly, a fire in the living-room
roared and crackled like imprisoned
music, dinner was in fullest preparation.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room Mrs. Burton, Mrs.
Graham and Miss Patricia were dressed and
waiting with every now and then one of
the Camp Fire girls flitting in and out with
a question or a piece of information. A
few days later and the cabin would be overflowing
with guests. For this reason the
Camp Fire guardian had wished her husband
to appear before any one else.</p>
<p>Between half-past six and seven he could
be looked for at the cabin, as the drive from
Saranac occupied something more than an
hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>But at seven o&rsquo;clock Captain Burton had
not come; at half-past seven Miss Patricia
insisted that dinner be served and Captain
Burton&rsquo;s set aside. At eight o&rsquo;clock she
demanded that Mrs. Burton go to her room
and lie down. Undoubtedly Captain Burton&rsquo;s
train had been delayed. Evidently
David was still awaiting him.</p>
<p>After half an hour of protest, as Miss
Patricia remained firm and Mrs. Graham
added her persuasions to Aunt Patricia&rsquo;s
commands, the Camp Fire guardian finally
did retire, appreciating that she would be
in a better state to receive her husband
and wishing him to see at once how much
she had improved.</p>
<p>A little after nine it chanced that the
half dozen Camp Fire girls were in the living-room
alone, Bettina playing softly on the
piano and Chitty imitating the notes with
her flute-like voice, when they heard the
noise of David and the sleigh approaching.</p>
<p>Fearing that their Camp Fire guardian
might be disappointed in case something
had prevented Captain Burton&rsquo;s arrival,
Bettina and Alice Ashton ran into the hall
opening the door before there was an outside
noise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>The next moment Captain Burton strode
in. He was not alone; accompanying him
was a girl wrapped in a shabby gray cloak
and with a warm scarf tied about her head
partly concealing her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Polly? I must see her at once.
We had a wreck on the road and a storm
also delayed us. Bettina, will you and
Alice please look after Miss Temple, Juliet
Temple, and persuade her to eat dinner and
go to bed. I&rsquo;ll introduce you to each other
more satisfactorily in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Bettina and Alice were startled and
none too pleased by an unexpected guest
under the present conditions, they were too
kind to show their attitude, observing that
the strange girl looked completely exhausted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Juliet Temple</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear, do you think this
the proper time to introduce a
stranger into our household?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton and Captain Burton were
walking up and down outside Tahawus
cabin the following morning. Wearing a
sealskin coat and a small fur hat and muff,
little was visible except Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s eyes
and the brilliant color in her cheeks wrought
by the still, clear cold.</p>
<p>Captain Burton, who was a good deal
older, was a middle-aged man with iron-gray
hair and dark eyes; a handsome, erect
figure, considerably taller than his companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I suppose not, Polly,&rdquo; he
returned, &ldquo;but I explained to you the circumstances
were exceptional. Here was a
girl who had been living in the same boarding
place with me, to whom I had been
saying good-morning and good-evening for
a number of weeks and now and then
stopping to talk for a few moments, suddenly
turned out into the world with no
money and apparently no friends whom
she could ask to aid her. I believe she has
friends, but preferred being independent.
Had I not assured her you were greatly in
need of some one, she would not have come
to you. She was careful to tell me that
although she had studied nursing a short
time, she was not a professional nurse,
having given up her studies in order to take
a position in Washington during the war,
being in need of funds and unable to wait
for her graduation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I convinced her that you were not so ill
as to require professional care, but required
some one to wait upon you, prepare special
dishes and write letters. In fact, I even
told her that a part of her work would be
that of a maid, but that I was sure you
would be extremely kind and that living
with you was a pleasure, Polly, under
almost any conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton laughed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>&ldquo;That was very kind of you, dear, but
scarcely true. I have an idea that Miss
Temple will form a different impression of
my character as an invalid if she overhears
Aunt Patricia&rsquo;s report of me. Besides,
Richard, don&rsquo;t you realize that Aunt Patricia
will never permit Miss Temple to usurp
her duties, which seem to consist in forcing
me to eat more food and sleep a greater number
of hours than any human being reasonably
can manage. As for the other tasks,
which I am perfectly well able to accomplish
for myself, there are half a dozen of the Camp
Fire girls more than willing to do whatever
I ask. Then there is my beloved Betty
Graham whom I have not seen intimately
in a number of years. We have made a
secret arrangement by which she pretends
to be acting as my secretary in order that
we may have a few quiet hours together.
As I do not write a dozen letters a week and
ordinarily write them myself, Betty does
not find her duties arduous. Really I do
not see what Miss Temple is to do for me
or for any one else. I am sorry for her of
course, but just at present the cabin is to
be unusually crowded. If the girl has no
money I suppose we must see that she is
able to board somewhere for a time,
although we haven&rsquo;t a great deal of money
ourselves these days, have we?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish Aunt Patricia were not so
generous. It is ridiculous for me to be living
in this state! Please don&rsquo;t let her find out
we must help Miss Temple until she is able
to secure work. She would then insist
upon undertaking the responsibility, besides
being immensely aggrieved at our having
thought of it. Her one idea is that I shall
have no reason to say I must go back to
work in order to help restore our fortunes.
Aunt Patricia seems to object to everything
in connection with the stage these
days, when once upon a time she loved it
dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Polly, Miss Temple will not accept
money. I offered to lend her a small
amount which she could repay when she
chose, but she declared that I was a comparative
stranger, and if she were forced
to borrow money had best apply to some
one who had known her longer and more
intimately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What I don&rsquo;t understand is why you
wrote me that you and Aunt Patricia were
greatly in need of some one and that you
were much worried over Aunt Patricia&rsquo;s
breaking down. I have had this in mind
some time and been worried. Women are so
extraordinarily inconsistent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and men so extraordinarily dull
sometimes, my dear. I plead guilty; I did
write you what you accuse me of, but that
was <i>months</i> ago when Aunt Patricia and I
were living here alone. Since then, as you
know, our household has changed completely.
Betty is here and all the Camp
Fire girls, and we even have a jewel of a
cook, Elspeth. You must talk to her.
Her people have lived in the Adirondacks
for years and yet she still has a trace of a
Scotch accent and uses Scotch words now
and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, as I know Miss Temple and
you do not, I presume I had best try to
explain the situation. But I must say I
am disappointed. I thought you were
particularly sympathetic with young girls,
Polly, after your experience as a Camp Fire
guardian. As far as I know Juliet Temple
is a charming girl and I see no reason why
she cannot be made a member of your
Sunrise Camp Fire club.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>Long ago Polly O&rsquo;Neill had been fairly
well known among her family and friends
for her quick temper, but the years and
life&rsquo;s discipline had taught her a measure
of self-control.</p>
<p>She flushed now and bit her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard, you are not fair,&rdquo; she said
finally. &ldquo;I <i>do</i> care for girls and I <i>am</i> sorry
for this Miss Temple. But I cannot undertake
to rescue every girl who is in a difficulty.
And as for making her a member
of our Camp Fire, I do wish you would try
to understand something of the Camp Fire
organization. The guardian does not select
the members of a Camp Fire club. She
may suggest a girl, but the choice really
rests with the other girls. I should never
think of asking my group of girls to include
any one who is a stranger and might be
wholly uncongenial. Besides, there are
certain tests before any girl can join the
Camp Fire. How old is this Juliet Temple?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only eighteen, I believe. She wishes
to be thought older; has been forced to
give the impression because of being obliged
to earn her living.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>Not liking the suggestion of deceit and
not having been attracted toward the newcomer
at their single brief meeting earlier
in the day, Mrs. Burton continued her walk,
saying nothing more.</p>
<p>Finally she laid her hand on her husband&rsquo;s
coat sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not quarrel, dear, when we have
not been together in so long a time. I shall
never be able to like your Miss Temple if
she has made you angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, but here comes Aunt Patricia
and I will ask her advice, Polly. She is
the greatest trump in the world and I owe
her more than I shall ever owe anyone for
her devotion to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Miss Patricia approached she was
seen to be wearing a heavy, long black coat
and a soft gray felt hat belonging to one of
the Camp Fire girls which, perched on top
of her head, gave her a rakish appearance.</p>
<p>Expecting to be ordered indoors, Mrs.
Burton observed that Miss Patricia was in
a particularly softened mood, due probably
to the arrival of Captain Burton, to whom
she was devoted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly is looking better, don&rsquo;t you think,
Richard? Yet it has been very difficult to
persuade her to do the things she should.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton slipped an arm through
Miss Patricia&rsquo;s. Captain Burton took her
other arm and the three continued to
promenade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absurd, Aunt Patricia, I have been a
perfect invalid! Some day you are going
to be sorry for all the unkind things you
say about me! I wish you would not just
at present, because Richard probably will
agree with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Patricia studied her two friends
closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly is not to be worried, Richard,&rdquo;
she said finally.</p>
<p>The younger woman laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, one can make anything useful,
even ill health! Aunt Patricia, we have
not quarreled seriously. Our difficulty
concerns the girl, Juliet Temple, whom
Richard brought to us last evening. I don&rsquo;t
see just how she is to fit into our household
under the present circumstances, while
Richard has a different point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Richard, &ldquo;and I appeal to
you, Aunt Patricia. After all, Tahawus
cabin belongs to you and not to Polly.
Here I have been attempting to play knight-errant
and my wife declines to uphold me.
A sorry knight-errant indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Miss Patricia was
saying conclusively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl shall stay here through the
Christmas holidays. No one shall be
without a home and friends at such a
season. It will be difficult I know, Polly
dear, but if you will talk to the Camp Fire
girls they will be kinder to Miss Temple
than any request from me could make them.
Strange as it may seem to you, Richard,
the Camp Fire girls are devoted to Polly
and she has an extraordinary influence over
them all. But Polly is quite right, we
cannot consider asking the girl to become
a member of our Camp Fire until we discover
whether or not the other girls like
and approve of her. You seem to know
singularly little concerning your own prot&eacute;g&eacute;e,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s laughter held a note of
teasing, as Aunt Patricia&rsquo;s directness was
always amusing unless one chanced to be
the victim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, well, perhaps that is true, but she
comes of excellent family, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<p>&ldquo;I care little about family, the question
is of the girl herself. Remember, I was a
poor Irish girl until my brother left me
his fortune, and have no aristocratic leanings.
Polly and I will leave you and talk
to the girl herself. I have little opinion of
a man&rsquo;s judgment in such a case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter with Richard,
Polly, he looks worried?&rdquo; Miss Patricia
demanded as they moved away. &ldquo;Is it
a question of money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, Aunt Patricia, at least
he said nothing to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the cabin the Camp Fire girls were
not visible at the present time. Several of
them were engaged with final Christmas
preparations, the others had gone for a
walk with Betty Graham.</p>
<p>Inside the living-room, sitting alone by
the fire, was the solitary girl who had appeared
so unceremoniously the evening
before.</p>
<p>She was crouched on the floor upon a
low stool looking in the flames when Mrs.
Burton and Miss Lord entered, but rose
up hastily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>Unusually tall, although not so tall as
Miss Patricia, Juliet Temple had ash-colored
brown hair and gray eyes and a
shy, almost colorless manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to have intruded upon you
in this fashion, Mrs. Burton,&rdquo; she began.
&ldquo;I suddenly lost my position in Washington
and Captain Burton was so kind, I did not
altogether realize what I was doing in
coming to you like this. Now I can see
that you can have no possible use for me
with so many girls about you. If you will
be kind enough to have some one drive me
back to the village I shall not trouble you
further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton put out her hand toward
the unknown visitor in a friendly fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will stay with us a few days in any
case, won&rsquo;t you, Miss Temple? Perhaps
after all you may be able to do something
for me, or for all of us. Who knows?
But in any event you must not think of
leaving us until we know that you go to
friends, where you will be happy. Was
there, by chance, anything beside the loss
of your position that made you wish to
leave Washington at once?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The girl hesitated and then spoke quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was a reason. May I tell
you what it was before you decide to allow
me to stay with you even a short time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s colorless face flushed warmly
and her listless manner so altered that Miss
Patricia stared at her in surprise. In
another moment she became convinced
that the newcomer had taken a sudden
intense fancy to Mrs. Burton. She had
seen this same thing occur before. Moreover,
she doubtless had some romantic
story that it pleased her to think of confiding
to so famous a woman as Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>Miss Patricia straightway left the room.</p>
<p>The instant after Juliet Temple stood
facing her companion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Burton, allow me to tell you at
once, while I have the courage. I could
not explain to Captain Burton, I did not
feel I could to any human being until I
met you. I was accused of having stolen
a small sum of money from the department
at which I was at work in Washington. It
was not true and yet I have only my word
to give you. My father was an army man
and a distinguished officer during the Spanish
war, so for his sake and because the
sum was small I was dismissed from my
position instead of being prosecuted. You
can see now why I did not wish to appeal
to friends to whom I would have felt I must
make this same confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s expression scarcely altered
save that she became a shade paler and
the lines about her mouth deepened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why would it not have been wiser to
have remained in Washington and proved
your innocence?&rdquo; Mrs. Burton inquired,
frowning a trifle and wondering why her
antagonism toward the girl had lessened
rather than been increased by her story.</p>
<p>Juliet Temple gave a despairing shrug
to her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been useless, I would not
have been permitted to continue at my
work. I could not have lived on in Washington
without money. I have but little
hope that I shall ever be cleared, yet if you
think I am guilty, and you have no reason
to believe otherwise, you must let me go
away at once, this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I really wish you to stay, and I did
not until this moment. At least you must
remain for a time until we learn to know
whether we like and trust each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton held out her hand a second
time and Juliet Temple touched her lips
to it without replying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Friends That Were</span></span></h2>
<p>Toward noon the next day the half
dozen other guests arrived, leaving
only Ralph Merritt to follow later.
He was not expected until Christmas eve,
so affording Peggy Webster a few days
with her family and friends.</p>
<p>Immediately upon her arrival the Camp
Fire girls formed a circle about her and as
soon as possible bore her off to a room in
one of the smaller cabins devoted exclusively
to their use.</p>
<p>This room was known as &ldquo;The Study&rdquo;.
Formerly it had been the living-room in the
smaller house, but at present was lined with
books and filled with Camp Fire trophies,
baskets, embroidery, sofa cushions, odd
pieces of weaving, and the Camp Fire
photographs depicting their various experiences,
which the girls always carried with
them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
<p>After the midday dinner the older guests
continued to sit about the big fire in the
living-room. David Hale, Dan Webster
and Philip Stead were invited to entertain
themselves for a short time without their
hostesses.</p>
<p>It was a little past two o&rsquo;clock when
Sally Ashton, who had been sitting curled
up on a corner of a sofa, not talking so
much as her companions, suddenly remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we might spare Peggy
any more questions for this one afternoon?
Whether she will confess to it or not, she
is looking tired. Besides, I feel that we
should pay more attention to our other
visitors. I do not mean mother and father,
I am thinking of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Greeted by an outburst of laughter,
Sally appeared mystified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sally dear, think not that we
expect you to be interested in the entertainment
of mere parents! The other
visitors you refer to are masculine. Well,
as they usually are attentive to you, after
all there is no reason why you should not
return the compliment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Neither is there any reason why you
should be so tiresome, Alice. I was only
going to propose that we go for a walk
before tea-time. The afternoon is clear
and there always is the possibility of a snow
storm by to-morrow. Perhaps in spite of
Alice&rsquo;s sarcasm, father and Captain Burton
may be induced to join us; the others
won&rsquo;t, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy Webster, who had been sitting on
a pile of Camp Fire sofa cushions, got up
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally, you always were the most sensible
one of us and I should enjoy a walk.
There were so many hours of sitting still on
the train. Besides, I agree with you that
we should no longer neglect Dan or Philip
Stead or Mr. Hale. Ralph is not here,
but I intend to help defend his sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peggy Webster, who was about nineteen
years old, was dark and vivid with a brilliant
color, full crimson lips, black hair and eyes
which of late had grown gentler in their
expression. Perhaps the most popular of
the younger group of Sunrise Camp Fire
girls, Peggy always had been singularly
sincere and courageous, besides possessing
the vitality which in itself is so magnetic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>To-day, studying Peggy Webster closely,
Mary Gilchrist felt a mingled sensation of
admiration and envy. There were certain
traits of character which she and Peggy
held in common, and in a way Gill cherished
the hope that she might fill Peggy&rsquo;s place
in their Camp Fire now that Peggy was so
soon to marry and leave them. Yet there
was also a fundamental difference between
them that Gill knew ever must stand in
her way, unless she were able to conquer it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no reason for wasting time in teasing
Sally. I consider that she has made
an extremely agreeable suggestion,&rdquo; Gill
protested.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Peggy Webster,
Bettina Graham, Mary Gilchrist, Marguerite
Arnot, Sally and Alice Ashton and
the small English girl, Chitty, who rarely
left Bettina Graham&rsquo;s side when it was
possible to be with her, set out, leaving
Vera Lagerloff to entertain Juliet Temple,
the girl who had come to the cabin so unexpectedly,
but concerning whose history
and character they had no knowledge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>To Mary Gilchrist&rsquo;s annoyance Allan
Drain had joined their three young men
guests, but she need not have troubled.
He attached himself to Bettina and Chitty
after a polite greeting to her, as soon as
they set out on their expedition.</p>
<p>In a walk composed of a large group of
people, the arrangement in the beginning
is apt to be haphazard, controlled more
by chance than choice.</p>
<p>Personally Bettina was glad that Allan
Drain seemed interested to walk beside
her, since this left David Hale free to be
with Marguerite Arnot. Otherwise his
sense of duty might have impelled him to
be attentive to her. He had come to the
cabin at her mother&rsquo;s invitation. Bettina
was convinced that he would find more
pleasure in Marguerite&rsquo;s company and that
they would be glad to talk over the past
year in France.</p>
<p>The walk was not to be of great length,
Mary Gilchrist having proposed that they
go to a low, cleared hill about a mile away
on the far side of Half Moon Lake for their
first toboggan ride.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>One of Miss Patricia&rsquo;s gifts, sent down
from Canada, had been a toboggan capable
of carrying eight persons. But to the
Camp Fire girls&rsquo; chagrin Mrs. Burton had
been unwilling to have them make use of
it until they had a masculine escort. Absurd
as her point of view appeared to several of
the more independent members of her
group of Camp Fire girls, no one had
appealed from her decision.</p>
<p>This afternoon, moving swiftly ahead
on snow shoes, Mary Gilchrist and Dan
Webster dragged the great sleigh, leaving
the others to follow as swiftly as possible.
No one of the others had acquired Gill&rsquo;s
skill in the management of snow shoes save
Dan Webster who had been brought up
on a New Hampshire farm and was a
trained athlete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gill and Dan look very handsome
together, don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; Alice Ashton remarked.
Tall and intellectual and not
especially good looking, Alice Ashton was
far from possessing her younger sister
Sally&rsquo;s popularity with men of all ages.
But at present she and Sally were walking
with their distant cousin, Philip Stead,
between them and, as Sally was not making
the faintest effort to entertain him, Alice
felt compelled to assume the responsibility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
<p>What was the difficulty with Sally? The
suggestion that they go for a walk had
been her own, and yet at present she looked
as uncomfortable and annoyed as Sally
ever permitted herself to appear. Undoubtedly
she must be angry or troubled by some
recent occurrence. Alice did not consider
that this offered a sufficient excuse for
Sally&rsquo;s entire lack of interest.</p>
<p>The new cousin, Philip Stead, might
have been an inanimate object walking
between them.</p>
<p>Sally looked extremely pretty, with more
color than usual, due to the sharp cold.
She was wearing Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s old seal-skin
coat and cap, Aunt Patricia having
presented the Camp Fire guardian with
handsomer ones at the beginning of the
winter in the Adirondacks. And Sally&rsquo;s
eyes and hair were nearly of the same shade
and softness as the brown furs. Notwithstanding,
she was frowning and her lips
had a pouting, sullen look like a disappointed
child&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Not appreciating the reason Alice was
puzzled and at the same time grateful that
the new cousin did not appear disturbed
by Sally&rsquo;s indifference, but sufficiently interested
in her to make the task of amusing
him simpler than she had imagined possible.</p>
<p>Alice was right. Sally was annoyed, she
was even unhappy, although she would
scarcely have agreed to this.</p>
<p>During the entire winter at Half Moon
Lake had she not been looking forward
almost daily to Dan Webster&rsquo;s visit at
Christmas time? Since their parting in
France she and Dan had written each other
occasionally, but neither of them wrote
especially well, so that the letters were
not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Well, Dan had arrived and so far they
had exchanged exactly eight words, the
self-same words, save for the interchange
of names: &ldquo;Hello, Sally, I am glad to see
you,&rdquo; and her own reply with no more
warmth or originality.</p>
<p>To herself at any rate she could confess
that she had proposed a walk in order that
she and Dan might have a brief time together
without half a dozen or more persons
surrounding them. If Dan only had made
an effort to walk beside her they might
easily have arranged to drop a few paces
behind the others.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>But Dan had made no such effort and
apparently had no such thought. Already
he and Mary Gilchrist were speeding on
an eighth of a mile ahead, Mary&rsquo;s golden
scarf and Dan&rsquo;s blue one, whipped by the
wind, were like gay pennants urging the
stragglers to follow.</p>
<p>But Sally could not walk rapidly on the
icy ground and already was out of breath.
Neither had she any interest in the arrival
at the summit of the hill, since the thought
of the tobogganing terrified her and she
had no wish to confess the fact.</p>
<p>Reaching the top of the hill, Sally allowed
Bettina Graham, her sister Alice, and Peggy
Webster to reveal their Camp Fire prowess
by starting a fire from the oily bark of a
white birch tree, while Dan Webster, Philip
Stead and Mary Gilchrist made the original
test of the toboggan slide.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour later, still
standing beside the now huge bonfire, Sally
never had moved a dozen paces away, and
this in spite of repeated invitation from
nearly every one of her companions to make
the journey down the long, smooth path of
ice to the edge of Half Moon Lake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I don&rsquo;t believe I would care
for it. Yes, I am a little afraid, besides I
should not like the long walk up the hill
when the ride is over,&rdquo; she had protested
politely but with the firmness the other
girls recognized as characteristic.</p>
<p>Dan Webster appeared either to be oblivious
to, or else to have forgotten Sally&rsquo;s
accustomed obstinacy. Not once but half
a dozen times he urged her to take part,
insisting that he would take care of her and
even bring her back up the hill. Sally
continued to shake her head: &ldquo;Thanks
very much, you are awfully kind, but I
had rather not,&rdquo; until finally even Dan
himself desisted.</p>
<p>Besides Sally Ashton there was one other
member of the party who would not be
persuaded to attempt the tobogganing&mdash;Allan
Drain.</p>
<p>Sally had once overheard a conversation
between him and Mary Gilchrist, and
afterwards the young man had wandered
off leaving her to guard the fire alone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you are afraid as Sally is,&rdquo;
Gill had said, and Sally, not annoyed in the
least by a reference to her cowardice, had
thought Gill never looked handsomer or
more vigorous, with her auburn hair blowing
from beneath her gray squirrel cap, her
cheeks glowing with health and her full lips
parted.</p>
<p>In contrast her companion had appeared
white and frozen, half lifeless, with all the
color gone from his face and his lips blue.
Really Gill was not kind, Sally concluded,
observing that Allan Drain had to hold himself
together to keep from shivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like a man who is a coward.
Life must be a great bore to anyone who
hates the outdoor world as you do and yet
is compelled to be a part of it. I know you
prefer a stuffy little room high up over a
city with your books and your poetry and
your dream of yourself,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>With a little light laughter, Gill disappeared
and a short time after Sally
observed the young poet start down the hill
on the way either to their cabin or his own.</p>
<p>When he had gone too far to hear her call,
Sally regretted that she had not accompanied
him. In spite of the fire she was
growing stiff with the cold. Already the
afternoon shadows were turning the white
world about her into softer tones of lilac
and gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>Sorry for her own suggestion, she now
longed to be back at Tahawus and with her
mother and father, who surely belonged to
her after their long talk with the others.
Nor did she wish any one to accompany her,
which was a part of her mood since ordinarily
nothing would have induced her to
walk any distance in the winter woods alone.</p>
<p>Fortunately to-day one had not to be so
careful of the trail. Here it was straight
down the hill they had just climbed together.</p>
<p>There was no one near. Allan Drain was
almost out of sight, yet his course would
serve as a guide.</p>
<p>The others, crowding the toboggan, were
midway down the steep incline.</p>
<p>Placing a fresh pile of wood on the fire
and warming herself as thoroughly as possible,
a moment later, without confiding her
intention, Sally set off alone down the snow-covered
mountain, carefully keeping in the
tracks made by herself and her friends a
short time before.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Anxious Waiting</span></span></h2>
<p>The first few yards of her trip downhill
Sally managed with comparative
comfort, but soon after the ice path
grew steeper and her footing less secure.
Then she would slide for a few feet, catching
at any tree or frozen shrub along her route.
A quarter of a mile away already she was
sorry she had attempted the descent alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice! Alice! Dan! Dan!&rdquo; she called,
hoping that some one of her friends had
discovered her absence and would come
searching for her. But no one answered
and no one came. Should she return up the
slope, or wait where she was until the others
returned? The time could not be long;
already they had been away from Tahawus
cabin two hours and had promised to return
before twilight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>Five minutes of waiting and Sally found
herself growing numb from the cold. She
had not been exercising, and toasting herself
in front of the open fire evidently had made
her more susceptible to the cold. Unquestionably
she must move on in one direction
or the other, and yet to go back would mean
that the return journey would be doubly
long. Besides, she wanted to be home. A
vision of her mother and father, of the Camp
Fire guardian, of their older guests seated
about the great fire in the living-room of the
cabin assailed her. Anxious they probably
were already at the failure of the younger
members of the house party to return.</p>
<p>Moving cautiously a few feet further
along, Sally&rsquo;s foot struck against a stone
concealed by the ice, yet her fall did not
appear to have injured her; as she lay
quiet she felt more dazed than hurt.</p>
<p>Soon after she was up and on her way
again.</p>
<p>But now the snow trail was no longer so
plain as it had been and she was therefore
obliged to study the route more carefully.
However, she concluded that if one kept
steadily down the hill toward the valley one
could not go far astray and once on level
ground walking would be less difficult.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>Yet if only she had not suggested this
outdoor excursion, which had proved such
a disappointment to her!</p>
<p>From cold, from fatigue and disappointment
the slow tears coursing down her
cheeks seemed to freeze into tiny crystals.
By and by she was so cold that she could
not move rapidly, although aware that in
action lay her only safeguard.</p>
<p>Another false step and Sally was glad to
awaken to the realization that her second
fall had brought her further down the hill.
In a quarter of a mile more doubtless she
would reach the frozen bank of Half Moon
Lake and be able to see the lights of their
camp on the farther side, for although the
lake was of considerable length it was not
more than fifty yards wide.</p>
<p>At the foot of the hill Sally found herself
in a small ravine, where the ice had formed
only a thin layer above the drifting snow.
Attempting to cross the ravine she sank to
her knees, but managed to flounder out
again.</p>
<p>In order to console herself she attempted
to recall various Camp Fire maxims which
might afford her courage or inspiration, but
concluded that concentration upon her task
left no opportunity for other ideas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>On the farther side of the ravine which she
did not remember to have crossed earlier in
the afternoon there was no gleaming surface
of water frozen into the winter landscape.</p>
<p>Instantly Sally appreciated that she had
lost the trail and had come down the hill at
some distant point from Tahawus cabin.
Across the lake at any hour of the day or
night one could see blue curls of smoke
rising from the cabin, or at dusk the lights
gleaming from the windows, but now no
human habitation was visible.</p>
<p>Sally was in a world of complete loneliness.
There is no loneliness, no silence so absolute
as the forest in winter. Except for the snow
birds, all the other birds have departed.
Save when they must seek food, the animals
keep their own cloisters; there are no leaves
to rustle on the trees, only the little crackling
noises due to intense cold.</p>
<p>How far was she at present from Tahawus
cabin or any shelter? An instant Sally
stood still. Curiously in the face of actual
danger she lost her sense of discomfort and
disenchantment and with a serious situation
possessed an extraordinary capacity for
calm judgment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>In an hour the woods would be in darkness.
There was no point in evading the
issue; she appreciated what was inevitable.</p>
<p>Yet she had no thought of surrender, not
for the present.</p>
<p>With the realization of the situation Sally
seemed to feel added strength and faith.</p>
<p>When the others arrived at Tahawus
cabin, finding that she was not there, a
search party would start out at once. If
only she had not broken her compass a few
days before, as she rarely left home without
it, at least she might have managed to walk
in the direction of Tahawus cabin and not
face the risk of going the opposite way.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the barricade of hills,
she could see toward the west that the sun
had descended, leaving a faint afterglow of
purple and yellow and rose on the dim white
peaks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Sally moved westward, believing Tahawus
cabin lay toward the west. But darkness
came at length and she grew more bewildered.
Moreover, she was nearly frozen.
Now and then she would pause to wave her
arms and stamp her feet, smiling at herself
meanwhile, a half frozen, childish smile.
In her fur coat with her waving arms, so
stiff they moved with difficulty, she must
have looked like an animated bear had anyone
seen her in the dusk.</p>
<p>Several times Sally stumbled and fell
forward, only to pick herself up and go
steadfastly on.</p>
<p>She had no fear of wild animals, most of
them were vanished from the Adirondack
forest; nor of the darkness was she afraid;
she was fearful of but two things, the cold
and the silence.</p>
<p>Moreover, always before her appeared the
picture of the gleaming fireplace at the
cabin. Once she put out her hands as if
she would warm them before it. Again she
felt her father&rsquo;s arms about her and her head
dropping half asleep against his shoulder.
Then Sally aroused herself more completely,
appreciating that drowsiness must be fought
above all other sensations, if one would
conquer the peril of freezing.</p>
<p>Twice Sally was under the impression
that she saw a tall figure approaching and
called Dan Webster&rsquo;s name, only to find
later that the figure she had hoped might
be human was a low tree with a pair of
forked arms.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Toward the latter part of her journeying
she had no impressions, almost no consciousness,
yet something must have guided her&mdash;instinct,
sub-conscious mind, call it what
you will.</p>
<p>A light drew her, as a light has drawn all
wanderers on the face of the earth.</p>
<p>Rising on the peak of a low hill appeared
a fairy palace with only the towers visible
as if built upon air, but nearer, almost
beside her, a small, uncertain light.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s hands beat against the closed door
of a small, one-room house.</p>
<p>The face of the man who opened the door
she had a faint impression of having seen
before, but afterwards she remembered
nothing but her own effort to reach the fire
and the man restraining her.</p>

<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Christmas Eve</span></span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Then you really did care, Dan,
when you feared I was lost and
that something tragic may have
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always intended to find you, Sally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet Dan Webster looked troubled.</p>
<p>He was standing staring down at the girl
who was sitting wrapped in a white woolen
cape before the log fire at Tahawus cabin.</p>
<p>Somehow Sally Ashton appeared several
years younger than before her adventure.
She was paler, the lines of her face thinner
and there was a little downward droop to
the corners of her full lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet in a way I did not find you
after all! I was merely tramping through
the woods calling your name when by accident
I saw a figure moving toward me, the
man whose little cabin you had stumbled
into. Fate was kinder to you than you
dream, Sally. Mr. Holden was on his way
to your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Sally slipped further down into the large
semi-invalid chair, ordinarily occupied by
Mrs. Burton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I implored him not to leave
me alone, Dan. I know it was selfish of
me and yet I wanted to wait till morning
before sending any word. I don&rsquo;t remember
that I was so frightened when I was wandering
around alone. I have not as much
imagination as the other girls, besides at
first I knew I must not allow myself to be
terrified and afterwards, well, afterwards I
suppose I really was too cold, Dan, to think
or care for anything in the world save getting
warm again. Yet I did think of mother
and father and you. I don&rsquo;t believe I
thought of Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s face wore an odd, childish expression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alice is so critical of me and of course
getting lost and nearly freezing was partly
my own fault and partly yours, Dan. But
what I intended to tell you was that as soon
as I recovered a little and had something
warm to drink, hot coffee, or tea, and had
rested, Mr. Holden&mdash;was that his name?&mdash;insisted
that he must leave me and tramp
to Tahawus cabin. It was miles away and
I knew no one could get back before midnight.
So suddenly it seemed to me I could
not stay alone. Before it had been so silent
and now I could hear strange sounds, the
barking of little foxes, the calls of animals.
I feared no one would return and I would
be forever lost in the tiny hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless Mr. Holden would go. He
told me I would be entirely safe and could
doubtless sleep until his return. Strange
that I should have seen him before! It was
one afternoon when Chitty and I were in
the woods not far away and he sat listening
to Chitty&rsquo;s singing. I was puzzled by him
then and am still puzzled. Did you ask
him, Dan, why he lived like a hermit? I
will some day, and I think he may tell me.
Anyhow I am very grateful to him. And
I was just falling asleep, Dan, when you
came and found me. Then together you
dragged me back on a sled. Do you know
I have scarcely been wide awake since
mother and father lifted me and brought
me into the cabin. And yet I am still
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>Back among a pile of cushions Sally
dropped her head as if she were not altogether
displeased by her present condition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, her companion watched her
anxiously.</p>
<p>Dan Webster was a tall, splendid looking
fellow, six feet in height, with blue eyes,
coal-black hair and extraordinary physical
vigor. He had been two years with the
American army in France, but at present
was only twenty-two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is perfectly natural that you should
be tired, Sally. I am only worried for fear
we are doing too much talking. Your
mother told me to keep you amused and
away from all the excitement. One question
I must ask. What did you mean by
saying a few moments ago that I was in
part responsible for your attempt to return
to the cabin alone and being lost in consequence?
Had I dreamed what you intended,
I should never have allowed it. It
really was nonsensical of you, Sally, to
attempt to come home alone; you know you
have less skill in outdoor things than the
other Camp Fire girls and less courage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally frowned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then all the more reason why you should
not have left me alone, first to walk up
the hill without even speaking to me and
afterwards to stand and freeze while you
continued to amuse yourself with Mary
Gilchrist. Of course Gill is athletic and has
lots of courage and is all the things I am
not, but you have always pretended to be
my friend, Dan, and I have not seen you
since we parted in France. You told me
then that I ought to return home because I
had less ability to help with reconstruction
work than the other Camp Fire girls. It is
always the things I lack that you notice,
isn&rsquo;t it? But you are right, I am tired and
would prefer not to talk any more. To
think that to-morrow is not only Christmas
but Peggy&rsquo;s wedding day! Little did any
of us dream that a white Christmas at Half
Moon Lake would see the first wedding
among our group of Sunrise Hill Camp Fire
girls! If you don&rsquo;t mind, will you leave me
alone for a little while now, Dan? No, I
don&rsquo;t wish to sleep; there are several things
I want to think about. I&rsquo;ll see you to-night
at supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go, Sally, until you explain what
you meant.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>Lowering her eyelids as if intending to
rest, Sally glanced at the tall figure towering
above her, through half open eyes which
afforded her a plain view of her companion,
but concealed her expression from him.</p>
<p>There was something in Dan&rsquo;s manner
which pleased Sally.</p>
<p>He looked so strong and masterful and
yet at the same time so hurt and puzzled.
It always had been a comfort and an amusement
that she understood him better than
he would ever understand her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I meant nothing except what I
said, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to talk of pretense in my friendship
for you, Sally, is so nonsensical. I have
cared for you ever since you were a little
girl more than I have cared for any one
save my own family. Of late, well, I might
as well be honest, after I saw you in France
I knew I cared more. I did not want to
speak of this to you, Sally, not for a time.
I feel as if somehow you were too young.
I know of course that in France Lieutenant
Fleury,<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a> the young officer you nursed, liked
you pretty well and then there was some
Englishman, but they were foreigners and I
suppose afraid to take a chance. I can&rsquo;t
say I blame them, although I did want you
back in your own country for selfish reasons
as well as for your own good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s brown eyes with their curiously
golden depth were wide open at this
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really never could like any one except
an American, Dan. I did not dream until
I was in Europe how much I cared for my
own country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan did not appear as pleased by this
speech as might have been expected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more than a hundred million
Americans, Sally, and I presume about ten
million young men. Is it your idea that
you care for them all alike because they are
Americans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alike,&rdquo; Sally returned. &ldquo;But about
Mary Gilchrist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan flushed and looked as if he wished
to make an angry retort. Then the sight
of Sally sitting warm and safe and sweet
before the open fire and the memory of the
hours he had tramped the frozen earth
hoping and yet dreading to discover her,
softened him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>&ldquo;About Mary Gilchrist you know there
is nothing to say, Sally, know it fully as
well as I. The other afternoon she needed
some one to help with the toboggan. I was
accustomed to the sport and fond of it and
knew how to run things when the other
fellows did not. To have remained with
you, which I would prefer to have done,
was to have affected everybody&rsquo;s pleasure.
If that is the reason why you started home
alone, I think you were pretty hard on us
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To make a confession of a mistake was
more difficult for Sally than for a more
impetuous temperament, yet she answered
with an air of unexpected penitence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> sorry, Dan. I was angry and
piqued and jealous perhaps. So I suppose
I deserved what happened to me, yet it
was not fair to make mother and father and
Tante and the others and you, Dan,
uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uneasy, well that is scarcely the proper
word, Sally. I have never been more
wretched in my life. I knew if I did not
find you and if all was not well with you I
should never have another happy moment.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Dan spoke simply but with such complete
sincerity that Sally made a little movement
and saw his hand reach out as if he wished
to touch her soft hair. Then the door
opened and Mrs. Burton, the Camp Fire
guardian, with her sister, Mrs. Webster,
came into the living-room.</p>
<p>They were twin sisters, at one time Polly
and Mollie O&rsquo;Neill, and among the original
group of Camp Fire girls.</p>
<p>They had resembled each other in the
past, but the years and difference in temperament
and experience at present made the
likeness less apparent. Mrs. Webster had
grown plump, there were lines of gray in
her dark hair, her checks were bright and
freshly colored. She had a look of gentle
and dignified maturity. Save for the death
of her son, Billy Webster,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> her life had been
one of happiness and fulfilment, devoted to
her husband and her two children, Dan
Webster and Peggy, and to her gifted sister,
Polly O&rsquo;Neill Burton, in the brief periods
when they were able to be together. In
fact, she looked ten years the elder; the
other woman&rsquo;s slender figure, her dark hair
and brilliant eyes, her vividness held no
suggestion of age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sally, dear, your mother is asking for
you and wants you to lie down for a little
while. The truth is I believe she is afraid
to have you out of her sight after your
behavior the other evening. Dan, will you
escort Sally? She seems to require some
one to look after her at present, although
she was once the Camp Fire heroine.
Mollie and I wish to decide upon the
arrangements of this room to-morrow.
Peggy has left all details to the other Camp
Fire girls and Bettina has asked our advice.
I suppose the ceremony ought to be performed
there between the two big windows
with the white world of beauty outside as
the background. But really, Mollie, how
you can be willing to permit our only and
beloved Peggy to be married in this abrupt
fashion is beyond my comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She came to us here at Tahawus cabin
that we might have a brief visit together
free from the thought of her marriage to
Ralph Merritt in the spring and lo, Ralph,
descends upon us and demands Peggy in
thirty-six hours! It is too impossible; you
and William should not have agreed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>Mrs. Webster placed her arm about her
sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Polly, Peggy told you she would
not dream of marrying Ralph in this abrupt
fashion unless you consented and believed
it the thing she should do. Not only are
you her adored aunt, but you have been
her Camp Fire guardian all these years
and I am accustomed to the idea that she
loves you, if not better, at least as well as
she loves me. Now if you are to make
yourself ill over this when you were getting
stronger, why Ralph can go to China alone
and Peggy wait until he is able to return for
her. I shall tell her you have changed your
mind and consented only because you did
not wish her to be unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose I did consent for that
reason, Mollie, all the more reason why I
must <i>not</i> change my mind. We can have
this room filled with Christmas evergreens
and Ralph tells me he has ordered roses and
lilies to be sent up from town. Our Peggy
shall be &lsquo;a white bride of winter&rsquo; and I
promise to pretend that I do not hate all
weddings save my own, and above all
others the marriage of my Sunrise Camp
Fire girls!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Romance</span></span></h2>
<p>The living-room at Tahawus cabin
suggested an outdoor cathedral.
Evergreens arched overhead; the
walls were lined with green branches of
holly, cedar and pine; while above the
mantel and hanging from the chandelier
were bunches of mistletoe, the white berries,
like captured snowflakes.</p>
<p>Between the front windows swung a bell
composed of mistletoe leaves with the
clapper of the white berries. Underneath
was an improvised platform with a background
of green and stalks of lilies and roses.</p>
<p>Yet the wedding ceremony was to be of
the simplest character with no outside
guests.</p>
<p>On Peggy&rsquo;s part this involved no especial
sacrifice, since nearly every one she cared
for deeply was at present in Tahawus cabin,
her father having arrived with Ralph
Merritt.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>Ralph&rsquo;s parents were the cause of the
hurried wedding. Spending the winter in
China, it had been their intention to return
home in the early spring in order to be
present at the marriage of their son and
Peggy Webster. However, a cable announcing
his mother&rsquo;s serious illness, had urged
Ralph to sail for China as soon as possible.
And he had the good fortune at the last
moment to persuade Peggy not to force him
to make the long journey alone.</p>
<p>There was no opportunity for the purchase
of wedding clothes, but Peggy was to
spend several days in New York, where she
could outfit herself for the journey.</p>
<p>The wedding was to take place at high
noon, with a clergyman from Saranac
officiating.</p>
<p>At exactly the moment of high noon, with
the clock in the hall chiming twelve strokes,
Peggy walked into the living-room on the
arm of her father. Her brother, Dan, was
best man and he and Ralph stood awaiting
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Afterwards the Sunrise Camp Fire girls
formed a semicircle about the bride, wearing
simple toilettes of white serge which had
been intended for the Christmas dinner
party.</p>
<p>Peggy&rsquo;s wedding dress was a white crepe
de chine without trimming of any kind save
an exquisite collar of Duchess lace, which
Miss Patricia had unexpectedly produced as
a wedding gift. Without a wedding veil
Peggy looked as her family and friends were
accustomed to seeing her at any time; her
color never wavered, her dark eyes remained
steadfast and untroubled, in fact she seemed
less agitated than any one of the other
Camp Fire girls.</p>
<p>Not far away from the little group the
Camp Fire guardian stood between her
husband and Miss Patricia. Having solemnly
promised Peggy not to break down,
her lips were firmly closed, her face white
with two bright spots of color in her cheeks,
yet her blue eyes less brilliant than usual.</p>
<p>Mrs. Webster cried softly during the ceremony,
nevertheless, her lips continued to
smile while her eyes were dim; her own
marriage had proved so satisfying and,
devoted to Ralph Merritt, she had the faith
to believe that Peggy&rsquo;s would be equally so.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>Mary Gilchrist, whose position was at
one of the ends of the semi-circle, toward
the close of the ceremony glanced toward
the group of people who were slightly more
in the background&mdash;Mr. and Mrs. Ashton,
and Philip Stead with Elspeth and David
Murray behind them and David Hale a few
feet away.</p>
<p>Beside the great fireplace Mrs. Burton
was standing near Allan Drain, who always
seemed to prefer her society to any other.</p>
<p>She had on a soft gray chiffon dress over
silk. In an irrelevant fashion it occurred
to Gill that Mrs. Burton was rather too
close to the open fire.</p>
<p>The next instant the impression vanished
as her interest in Peggy recurred. Yet the
subconscious thought must have remained,
for scarcely aware of her action a second
time she turned her head to behold a little,
light flame flare suddenly amid the folds of
the soft material and spread with amazing
rapidity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>She was a number of yards away and a
movement on her part would interrupt the
ceremony, now at its most solemn moment.
Besides, Mrs. Burton, or some one near,
must know what was occurring before she
could dream of reaching her. Transfixed,
she remained staring perhaps not thirty
seconds. Then she saw Mrs. Burton utter
a little cry that was almost soundless, so
promptly was it suppressed. Not wishing
to destroy the beauty of the ceremony or to
attract attention, unwisely she turned to
escape from the room and with her first
movement the blaze so increased that she
appeared to be standing in a circle of flame.</p>
<p>However, Allan Drain immediately threw
his arms about her and was holding her still,
while at the same time he was beating out
the flames. The following instant David
Hale, aware at last of the situation, snatched
a heavy shawl from a chair, enfolded Allan
Drain and Mrs. Burton inside it.</p>
<p>It was all so quickly and quietly accomplished
that Peggy and the other Camp Fire
girls had no knowledge of what had taken
place until the service was ended.</p>
<p>The others had seen it, and yet for Peggy&rsquo;s
sake, as the danger was past, had made no
outcry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, Betty, I do not understand how
you could have been so careless,&rdquo; Mrs.
Burton protested almost irritable from
fright, when Peggy and Ralph had turned
and were surrounded by their mother and
father, the Camp Fire girls, Dan and Mr.
and Mrs. Ashton.</p>
<p>Only Bettina and Mary Gilchrist moved
over to the smaller group encircling Mrs.
Graham and almost concealing her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not hurt, Bettina dear, don&rsquo;t be
alarmed. And, Polly, it was careless of me,
I am sorry to have frightened you. No, I
am perfectly all right, only I am afraid Allan
Drain is hurt. I am so sorry, Allan, I seem
to be your evil genius. Bettina, suppose
you come with us and please don&rsquo;t let any
one else trouble; I would so regret disturbing
Peggy&rsquo;s and Ralph&rsquo;s wedding. We will
come back in a few moments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the little group disappeared, accompanied
by David Hale and Mary Gilchrist,
who followed after them to offer assistance.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later they all
returned to the living-room save Allan
Drain. Mrs. Burton, having changed her
dress, showed no trace of her recent peril
and begged that there be no discussion of it.</p>
<p>Peggy and Ralph were to remain for
Christmas dinner at two o&rsquo;clock and afterwards
to leave for New York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>The dinner was the usual Christmas feast,
but because Miss Patricia was hostess, she
had ordered from the great city beautiful
favors and bonbons as well, the principal
favor a tiny log cabin with a small camp
fire glowing outside upon a little surface of
crystal to represent the frozen earth.</p>
<p>Before four Peggy and Ralph departed,
driven to Saranac by David Murray and
soon after a slight atmosphere of depression
descended upon Tahawus cabin.</p>
<p>The older members of the house party
departed to their own rooms, including
Bettina Graham who felt Peggy&rsquo;s marriage
more keenly than the other Camp Fire girls,
besides being worried over the possible
nervous shock to her mother from the catastrophe
of a few hours before.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire guardian was about to
drop down on her couch to rest, and Captain
Burton sat reading by the fire, when a knock
at the door of her bed-room, which Mrs. Burton
opened, admitted Miss Patricia Lord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in for a moment to find out how
you have borne the day&rsquo;s excitement,&rdquo; she
began in a tone of unexpected gentleness.
&ldquo;You look rather better than I anticipated.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton put her arm about the
angular figure and drew her down on the
couch beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it feel like to be a Christmas
fairy godmother, Aunt Patricia&mdash;unlike
being a fairy godmother during the remainder
of the year. But you look tired yourself,
dear, or if not tired something is the
matter. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Patricia&rsquo;s expression was unusual, a
little shamefaced and appealing, altogether
unlike her ordinary air of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to do me a favor, Polly. I
came in to ask you and Richard when I
hoped to discover you alone. I have wished
to find you some little Christmas offering,
but could not be sure of what you might
desire, besides being shut off up here. So I
thought perhaps you might get what you
wish and so keep me from making a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Flushing, and not glancing toward Mrs.
Burton, Miss Patricia thrust into her hand
a small slip of paper, and when her eyes fell
upon it she discovered it to be a check for
a thousand dollars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is merely a small Christmas gift,
Polly, which I trust you will not speak of,&rdquo;
Miss Patricia announced in her more familiar
tone of severity before the younger
woman had an opportunity to respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Richard,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton said finally, her
voice a little uncertain, &ldquo;Aunt Patricia has
just given us a check for a thousand dollars,
which of course we cannot accept, chiefly
because she is the most generous person in
the world, and if she is permitted to go on
in this fashion some day will have no money
at all. Dear, you know I am everlastingly
grateful and that Richard and I already
owe you more than we would be willing to
accept from any one else, but really we
cannot take this as well. There is your
home in France for war orphans which must
absorb a portion of your capital and then
the expense of this cabin and all you have
done for me and the girls this winter. You
know how deeply I appreciate the added
gift, dear, but you must try and see that it
is out of the question for Richard and me
to be under further obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>&ldquo;Obligation!&rdquo; Miss Patricia repeated.
&ldquo;Were you my own daughter, Polly&mdash;and a
dozen times I have told you that I am as
much attached to you as if you were&mdash;would
you treat my gift in this fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, dear, I think so. Please do
not be hurt, I have told you Richard and I
could not accept gifts of money from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaning over, Miss Patricia took the
check from the younger woman&rsquo;s hand,
tossing it into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume you agree with Polly, Richard,
since you have made no remark,&rdquo; she added.
Then, notwithstanding their protests and
effort at persuasion, she arose and stalked
out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have wounded Aunt Patricia very
deeply, I am afraid, Polly,&rdquo; Captain Burton
said the next moment. &ldquo;However, I suppose
you were right and that it was unavoidable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had flung herself down on
her couch.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I was right, Richard, and you
need not have placed the entire responsibility
of the refusal upon me. Do you suppose
I enjoy wounding Aunt Patricia any
more than you do? Was there ever any
one so dear and so difficult? She will not
forgive me in many a day! The truth is,
Richard, Aunt Patricia has conceived the
idea that you are worried over some money
difficulty and would like to give us a good
deal more money if we should need it. Can
she by any chance be right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, Captain Burton walked over to
the fireplace and stood looking into the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Polly, Aunt Patricia is never
altogether mistaken. One can trust always
to her wisdom and kindness. We have some
investments which of late have not been
turning out so well as I hoped. Yet at
present there is no occasion to be troubled;
after a little they will adjust themselves. I
beg of you not to worry or in any way to
allow the idea to interfere with your
recovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are telling me the truth, Richard?
I object to being treated like a child or an
invalid when I am neither. I am ever so
much better and there is no reason now why
I should not be allowed to return to work.
In a year I feel convinced I could again be
fairly successful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not refer to the subject, Polly.
Before I should agree to such rashness I
would appeal to Aunt Patricia. However,
there is no necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>&ldquo;But you promise to let me know if there
should be a necessity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At first Captain Burton made no reply
and then said smiling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly, there are times when I agree with
Aunt Patricia, that you are a trying person.
I presume I shall be forced to tell you, but
there will be no occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this discussion the living-room of
Tahawus cabin was gradually being deserted.</p>
<p>Dan Webster, David Hale, Philip Stead
with Alice Ashton, Marguerite Arnot and
Vera Lagerloff had departed for an hour&rsquo;s
walk, the other girls having declined for
various reasons. Alone before the fire with
an open book, Allan Drain was trying to
amuse himself and to forget the pain whose
existence he steadfastly had been denying.
There was nothing serious the matter, save
that his hands had been burned, and, in
spite of the cooling bandages in which they
were wrapped, continued to ache.</p>
<p>With difficulty he could turn the pages
of his book, so that he immediately heard
the rustle of a soft silk gown and glanced
up to find Mrs. Graham beside him. She
had taken off her more formal dress and
was wearing a light blue tea gown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came in to ask if there was anything
I could do for you, Allan? I am afraid you
are pretty uncomfortable in spite of your
denial of the fact. I have been wishing
there was some way in which I could make
up to you for the loss of your verses, but
instead I am more than ever under obligation.
I don&rsquo;t intend to allow myself to
think of what might have happened this
morning except for your presence of mind
and courage. What are you reading?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A volume of new plays, some one seems
to have sent Mrs. Burton. I did nothing
for you this morning; it was David Hale
who really rescued us both, Mrs. Graham.
Yet there is something you can do for me.
I wonder if I am asking too much? Could
you, would you ask Mrs. Burton to glance
over a one-act play I lately have been struggling
to write? A single word, or suggestion
from her would be the greatest help
and inspiration to me, more than you can
dream. It is not that I think my little play
is worth anything, yet if she only considers
the idea worth while, why, some day I may
be able to do something with it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why, of course Polly shall read your
play and give you her criticism, although I
warn you, she may not be flattering. Doubtless
she would have read it had you asked
her yourself. She certainly will now that
I shall allow her no peace of mind until the
fact is accomplished. You are going to
stay with us a few days until you have
recovered, but Bettina will walk over to
your cabin with you to-morrow and bring
back your manuscript. We shall see this
manuscript does not come to grief. Good-by,
go back to your reading, I&rsquo;ll not interrupt
you any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Allan Drain did not return to his
reading; instead he allowed the leaves of his
book to close while he sat gazing into the
fire. He had been afraid he would not have
sufficient courage for the request he had
just made, but now having gone through
the ordeal he wondered whether or not he
regretted his own act. Doubtless the little
play was no good and Mrs. Burton would
be tired and bored by being forced to devote
a half hour to it. Moreover, she was too
sincere an artist not to give him her true
opinion, and afterwards he would never
have the steadfastness to go on with his
writing, knowing her estimate of his work.
This winter was going to be difficult enough,
so why not better have kept this dream at
least until the spring, when he need not be
so much indoors?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>On this occasion Allan Drain did not hear
the door open, nor glance up until Mary
Gilchrist stood beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Mrs. Burton in the hall and she
suggested that I come in and offer to read
to you if you will allow me. She said you
were having some trouble in trying to turn
over the pages of your book. I do not read
very well, but it would give me a great deal
of pleasure if you will let me make the
attempt. Then if you can&rsquo;t bear my effort,
why I&rsquo;ll stop and not be in the least offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill&rsquo;s manner was so friendly and had in
it such a new atmosphere of shyness, almost
of apology, that Allan Drain, although not
anxious to have his reverie interrupted, did
not like to decline.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it would be pleasanter to talk;
I can read at any time, as I am so much
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Declining a chair, Gill dropped down on
the floor before the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">188</div>
<p>&ldquo;Will you talk to me? I should like it
ever so much better. There is something I
want specially to say to you&mdash;I want to
apologize for my bad manners ever since
our original meeting. You see, you said
something then which annoyed me and
afterwards impulsively I did something for
which I never have forgiven myself, so ever
since I have in a way wished to believe you
responsible. I thought you had no courage,
because you are not the kind of man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hesitating, Gill flushed hotly. How hopelessly
stupid and awkward she was! Actually
she was about to say the very thing
she intended not!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am not the kind of fellow you
admire. Go on, Miss Gilchrist. You
don&rsquo;t suppose I have any illusions on the
subject, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;no,&rdquo; Gill answered. &ldquo;Only
to-day I discovered that you possessed both
courage and presence of mind, the very
traits of character I <i>do</i> admire. Besides,
at this moment I appreciate you are in lots
of pain, your face shows it, and yet you
would rather not have me mention the fact.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>

<p class="caption"><span class="sc">&ldquo;I Wish You Would Help Me About Something,&rdquo; She Said.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">190</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would help me about something,&rdquo;
she went on. &ldquo;The truth is, I seem
to possess no moral courage, and somehow
I feel that you do. I have been guilty of a
fault that I am ashamed and afraid to confess.
It has troubled me for weeks and I
have been a good deal more unhappy than
any one has realized. I really have wronged
you more than any one else, and this morning
while Peggy Webster was being married I
decided I must confess to some one and that
perhaps I had best confess directly to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea what you
are talking about,&rdquo; Allan Drain protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not,&rdquo; Gill answered.</p>
<p>She had thrown back her head so that
her face was slightly upturned. The light
was on her red-brown hair, leaving her face
in shadow. Yet Allan Drain observed that
the gallant half boyish expression which she
ordinarily wore had vanished and that her
square, too determined chin was trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you quickly and please don&rsquo;t
interrupt, else I might not be able to go on.
I have done you the greatest injustice, and
not only you, but Mrs. Graham and Bettina,
whom I like so much and whose good
opinion I would give a great deal to possess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;You remember when you brought your
collection of verses here for Mrs. Graham
to read and she told you afterwards that
she had placed them upon a table in her
bed-room, and then, after being away for
a few hours, on her return discovered they
had vanished?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not likely to forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I went into Mrs. Graham&rsquo;s bedroom
while she was away and saw the verses
lying among some books and papers. As I
was curious and wished to read them, although
I thought they would be poor, I
took them to my own room. I had no
opportunity to read them then, as I went
for a walk soon afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes alight, Allan Drain leaned
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have them and will return them
to me! I appreciate they are no good, just
the same they mean a great deal to me.
You would not be so unkind as to keep
them when they are of no value to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, the trouble is I have <i>not</i> the verses.
You see, you see, I destroyed them. Please,
please don&rsquo;t believe I intended this, it was
wholly an accident, and yet so dreadfully
stupid perhaps you can scarcely believe me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not wishing the other girls to know I
was sufficiently interested to have borrowed
the poems, I hid your manuscripts in an old
box with some papers of no value. Then,
this is the incredible thing, I forgot they
were there. It was only a moment of forgetfulness;
I remembered when it was too
late. Later in the same afternoon I decided
suddenly to clear out my bureau drawer and
so piled all the trash I could find into this
self-same box and carried it into our study
and flung the box and everything it contained
into the fire. The instant the papers
caught fire I knew what I had done. I did
thrust my hands into the flames only to
draw forth a few charred scraps without a
single line upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill drew up her sleeve; the scar from a
burn showed above her wrist.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>&ldquo;See I burned my arm in the attempt,&rdquo;
she murmured indifferently, &ldquo;not that I
cared except that I have had trouble in
hiding the burn from the other girls. The
worst thing I have done was not so much
the accident and my foolish loss of memory,
but the fact that when Mrs. Graham and
Bettina asked if I had seen the manuscripts
of your poems, I told them no, or at least I
deliberately gave them this impression.
Yet all the days of my life I have esteemed
truthfulness and a sense of honor the greatest
of all human possessions. This is why
I have never been able to make the confession.
I could not pass through Christmas
day without telling you and to-morrow I
shall speak to Mrs. Burton, Mrs. Graham,
and Bettina and let them know of what I
have been guilty. Afterwards I shall go
home, I cannot remain here at Tahawus
cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor can I say that I forgive you, Miss
Gilchrist. If I should say so I would not
be telling the truth. I&rsquo;ll do my best to
forget after a time. After all, I had given
up any idea of my verses being restored, so
I am not much worse off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gill arose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>&ldquo;I much prefer your not pretending to
forgive me, because you could not mean it
truthfully. After I leave Half Moon Lake
I hope we may never see each other again.
I cannot exactly explain, but I felt when I
met you that you would have an unfortunate
influence upon me. Now I can never
see you without recalling that because of
you, or through you, I have done what I
never could have believed of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Allan Drain responded
stiffly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I, but that makes no real difference
now. I hear the others returning.
Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">An Encounter</span></span></h2>
<p>While Gill and Allan Drain were
having their interview in the
living-room, Bettina Graham
slipped out of Tahawus cabin alone and
carrying her skates walked down to the
edge of Half Moon Lake.</p>
<p>She had been depressed all day; Peggy&rsquo;s
marriage and departure to a foreign country
meant more to her than most persons
dreamed. They had been intimate and
devoted friends since they were tiny girls,
and Bettina believed their friendship could
never again have its old value.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>The fact that Peggy appeared to have
found her place in the scheme of things also
affected Bettina, because of late she herself
had felt that she must find some more
definite outlet for her own life. Her school
days were over unless she were to choose
some special course of study; this winter in
the mountains, delightful as it had been in
many respects and not without its useful
lessons, nevertheless seemed to be a pause
and not a step forward in any particular
direction.</p>
<p>Unwilling to confess either to her mother
or Camp Fire guardian who would be
wounded by the knowledge, Bettina had
been far more restless and dissatisfied for
the past few months than any one had
imagined. This afternoon her restlessness
had culminated.</p>
<p>Kneeling down, she fastened on her
skates.</p>
<p>Twilight was approaching, the distant
snow-covered hills were amazing studies in
purple, from pale violet to the deeper tones.
The surface of the lake itself bore the
reflections of a crystal ball.</p>
<p>Bettina started skating slowly, wishing
to pursue her own train of thought. She
knew what her mother expected of her;
they had been discussing the subject this
afternoon, and Bettina not only recognized
the reasonableness of her mother&rsquo;s position,
but would have been hurt had she felt
otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>Naturally after two years of absence
abroad, her father and mother looked forward
to her returning to Washington and
entering society. She was no longer young
enough to plead for more time, the war was
past and she had been allowed to devote
herself to its service. This winter in the
Adirondacks was due to a special set of circumstances,
her Camp Fire guardian&rsquo;s illness,
her father&rsquo;s long absence from Washington,
and her mother&rsquo;s desire to be with
Mrs. Burton and her group of Camp Fire
girls. In another six weeks her mother
probably would join her father in the west
and conclude the trip with him. She would
then go back to Washington and they were
looking forward to a happy summer together
in their own cottage by the Blue Lagoon.
So far Bettina knew nothing save happiness
in the prospect before her, but after the
summer, her mother had been planning this
very afternoon a brilliant winter in Washington
society.</p>
<p>Why could she not feel the interest that
any other normal girl in the world would feel
in such a future, with a successful marriage
as its climax?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>Yet Bettina knew she only dreaded it
with an even deeper antagonism than she
had felt in the past.</p>
<p>If only she and her brother, Tony, might
have changed places? Tony was as strikingly
handsome as their mother was beautiful
and possessed her social grace and charm
of manner.</p>
<p>Bettina believed she had neither; it was
not merely a matter of appearance; there
were persons who thought her reasonably
good looking in her own fashion. Besides,
she and her Camp Fire guardian had discussed
the subject many times, and she
herself had witnessed in Mrs. Burton a
triumph of personality which always transcends
mere physical beauty. Her own
distaste was a far more important factor.
In the midst of a group of society people
Bettina knew she always was obliged to
fight a sense of awkwardness, of shyness,
and that she had no conversation and no
animation. She could only prove a disappointment
to her mother, and yet was it
not fair that she should make the experiment?
Against her own judgment and
desire, her mother had allowed her the past
two years of freedom in her Camp Fire life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>Bettina was skating more rapidly than at
first, and without her knowledge her depression
was fading. The cold air stung her
cheeks, but her blood flowed warmly; this
portion of the lake was smooth as glass.
Finally a smile appeared at the corners of
her lips. Perhaps she was taking herself
and her own future too seriously, as this
was one of the faults of her character.
Moreover, doubtless she was spoiled. Never
had she to contend against real difficulties
such as many other girls face. Marguerite
Arnot, for instance, friendless and oftentimes
ill, for years had been forced to earn
her own living.</p>
<p>If at this instant Bettina could only have
beheld herself with other eyes she would
have appreciated her own good fortune
more keenly.</p>
<p>Her skating costume was of the color she
most affected, a soft, deep-toned blue serge,
neither light nor dark blue, with a short
skirt and coat. About her throat she was
wearing a beaver fur and on her head a cap
of beaver nearly the shade of her own hair,
one of her mother&rsquo;s Christmas gifts, and
carrying a small muff.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>Her complexion, at times too pale, was
now a lovely combination of white and rose.
Tall and slender, Bettina was always exceptionally
graceful, but more conspicuous than
any other characteristic was her air of high
breeding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a part of the wind? Won&rsquo;t you
please pause and wait for a fellow mortal
who has not your swift skill?&rdquo; Bettina
heard a voice behind her calling, and turning
skated slowly back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought you were off for a walk,
Mr. Hale; the cabin was nearly deserted
when I escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was, Miss Bettina, but our walk
was over a half hour ago and I inquired of
your mother what had become of you. I
have been following you for the past fifteen
minutes. You observe that I skate abominably
and yet I was determined to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina extended her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a bit out of practice; perhaps
if you take my hand I can be of some
assistance. It was kind of you to care to
join me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment they skated along in silence,
David Hale gaining in prowess from the
touch of the gloved fingers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>&ldquo;Does it occur to you, Miss Bettina, this
is the first opportunity I have had to
exchange a word with you alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but you only arrived a
short time ago and we have been having a
pretty strenuous existence at Tahawus cabin
for these last two days. I hope you have
not been bored by being forced to be a
guest at a wedding, which was as unexpected
to us as to you. I want to thank you for
your presence of mind this morning. Mother
and Mr. Drain would have been more seriously
injured except for you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;I was a dunce, Miss Bettina, not to
have discovered sooner what was taking
place almost beside me. I suppose I was
too interested in the wedding ceremony.
But in any case all the danger and therefore
all the credit is due Allan Drain. I confess
I am a little envious of his position as hero
and my own as anything else. I would give
a good deal to have you and your mother
grateful to me. You seem altogether to
have forgotten our friendship. Oh, I do
not mean you are not friendly, but I believed
we were more than ordinarily friendly during
the months in France. I hoped when
we met again that we might take things up
where we left off on that enchanting afternoon
in the Queen&rsquo;s secret garden at Versailles.
Now I see I must begin again at
the beginning, but I am a persistent person
and am looking forward to your return to
Washington. Then you will be meeting so
many people and no doubt will be a great
belle, so I am afraid my opportunities for
seeing you there will be limited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina moved so slowly that the two
skaters appeared to be poised like birds
about to take wing for further flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am forced to make my d&eacute;but in
Washington next winter if you <i>will</i> be good
to me I shall be more grateful than you
realize. I know I shall be a dismal failure.
Really I don&rsquo;t mind for myself so much as
for my mother; I am afraid she is going to
be dreadfully disappointed in me, and she
always has been in a fashion. It is hard
when people love each other a great deal
and yet have no congeniality of taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not follow your friend Peggy
Webster&rsquo;s example and so escape the society
adventure altogether?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Bettina shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I don&rsquo;t like to quote tiresome
old axioms, but one has heard of the frying
pan and the fire. Besides, one cannot follow
Peggy&rsquo;s example all alone. By the way,
did you and Marguerite Arnot manage to
have your walk together? I hope so. Isn&rsquo;t
Marguerite charming? I envy her exquisite
manners. You know she is coming to spend
next winter with us in Washington; mother
has persuaded her. Sometimes I think it
might be well if some witch or fairy should
force Marguerite and me to change places.
She could fill my place so much more gracefully,
however, than I could her&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could never change places in my
estimation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bettina laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never anticipated such an honor.
But come let us go back to the cabin, the
darkness is nearly upon us. Isn&rsquo;t the
evening exquisite? See the little half moon
rising there above our lake! I am sorry,
but I cannot stay out longer, I promised I
would not. It has been nice to have this
little talk with you.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Closed In</span></span></h2>
<p>The week following the end of the
Christmas holidays, Mary Gilchrist
said good-by to her Camp Fire
group and returned home.</p>
<p>She had made her confession to Mrs.
Graham, to the Camp Fire guardian and to
the girls themselves. If they were surprised
or disappointed, the decision to leave
Tahawus cabin was Gill&rsquo;s own.</p>
<p>No one precisely understood the situation.
Save for Peggy Webster, Gill had
appeared the frankest and most straightforward
of their number. The accident to
the manuscript was unavoidable, her refusal
to confess the accident, her evasion of the
truth as little like Gill as any one could
imagine.</p>
<p>Nor could Gill explain even to herself her
unexpected deceit and cowardice. She was
more astonished, more disappointed in her
own character than any one else.</p>

<p>Her talk with her Camp Fire guardian
upon this subject she felt she would always
remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, of course I am grieved and in
a way angry. You have forced Mrs. Graham,
whom I love better than most persons,
to bear a sense of guilt and a burden of
responsibility that was your&rsquo;s and not her
own. I have seldom seen Betty more
worried and it has affected the pleasure of
her winter with me which I desired to be
especially happy. Yet the fact that you
have committed the very fault you believed
most foreign to you is not so unusual as you
consider it, Gill dear. Life has a fashion of
tricking us in our preconceived notions of
ourselves. She has done the same thing
to me and it is one of her bitterest lessons.
Of course one has only to try to see that she
does not succeed again. I wish you did not
feel you were forced to leave the Camp Fire
because of your fault. If membership in
the Camp Fire demanded perfection I am
afraid our number would not be large. You
know it only demands an ideal and the
effort of getting up and going on after a
mistake or a downfall which brings one
nearer the ultimate goal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Gill had been silent for a few moments
afterwards, seated on the floor beside her
Camp Fire guardian in her bed-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, I think it would be best
for me to return home,&rdquo; she said finally,
&ldquo;although the girls also have been kind
enough to urge me to remain. Beside my
own feeling that I have in a measure
betrayed the trust of the Camp Fire, of
late I have received several letters from my
father telling me that he was lonely and
needed me. I have been too long away,
but some day perhaps I shall be able to
return and once more be a member of the
Sunrise Camp Fire. Until then I hope you
will not forget me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So early in the new year Gill vanished
from the household at Half Moon Lake and
a month later Mrs. Graham departed.
Afterwards the winter closed in about
Tahawus cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>The thermometer fell to ten, then twenty,
then thirty degrees below zero. Very rarely
now did the snow ever fall, only the ice
packed thicker and deeper, the limbs of the
trees laden with winter&rsquo;s burdens now and
then breaking, fell stiffly to the earth. The
wind rarely blew with any fierceness and
the cold was extraordinarily still.</p>
<p>Actually the household felt the coldness
less than any one of them anticipated.
Rarely a day passed by but the greater
number of them were out walking or skating
or skiing. Frequently David Murray
or one of the girls drove the sleigh to
Saranac for provisions and mail. And as
she grew stronger, Mrs. Burton was able to
accompany them on their shorter excursions.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was the long evenings at
Half Moon Lake that the Sunrise Camp
Fire ever hereafter was to recall as adding
a peculiar value and interest to their winter
in the Adirondacks.</p>
<p>The darkness fell between half-past four
and five o&rsquo;clock, by six the final afterglow
had departed from the crown of hills, and
above them hung the stars or the pale
winter moon.</p>
<p>Inside Tahawus cabin at this hour there
was added warmth and cheerfulness. More
logs were piled on the open fires, David
Murray heaped the furnace with a fresh
supply of coal, lamps were lighted and one
by one the girls, their daily tasks accomplished,
wandered into the big living-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>Elspeth had continued to live with them,
utterly declining to return to the loneliness
and lack of comfort in her brother&rsquo;s bachelor
establishment. Owing to her presence the
daily program had been changed.</p>
<p>Afternoon tea was no longer a feature of
the day, but instead, as Elspeth expressed
it, high tea was served at six o&rsquo;clock. This
was a custom among Scotch and English
country people and admirably suited to the
girls at present, since it afforded them long,
uninterrupted evenings, when they were
able to read, write letters, sew, or play
games, or entertain themselves in a variety
of fashions.</p>
<p>But by and by, without a prearranged
plan, one entertainment began to be appreciated
beyond all others. From eight
o&rsquo;clock until her early bed-time Mrs. Burton
read aloud, at first an occasional short story,
then as this did not seem to tire her, one or
two plays that were her especial favorites.</p>
<p>There were several new plays of unusual
quality that were among the New York
winter successes. Mrs. Burton sent for
these, hoping not to become altogether out
of touch with the public taste.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>Occasionally the beauty of a few poetic
lines or the dramatic value of a situation
caused her to forget the character of her
little audience. Then her voice and manner
revealed the old enchanting quality which
had made her famous.</p>
<p>On these occasions Allan Drain, who
trudged over every evening when it was
possible, oftentimes spending the night in
the smallest of the cabins which held no
other occupants, used to sit with his head
bent seeing and hearing nothing save the
magic beauty of the voice able by a swift
change of tone to call forth tears or laughter.</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton had read his play and had
not thought it altogether bad; had even
made suggestions so that he was re-writing
it for the third time.</p>
<p>The Camp Fire girls were accustomed to
their guardian&rsquo;s gift and therefore accepted
it in a more matter-of-fact fashion, although
Bettina Graham and Alice Ashton were
both aware that she was showing added
power, and understood her impatience to
return to her profession.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>One other person besides Allan Drain
appeared to be completely under the spell
of Mrs. Burton&rsquo;s art, but apparently she
responded to no one else. Since her unexpected
arrival at Tahawus cabin, Juliet
Temple had made no effort to make friends
with any member of the Camp Fire, nor
showed any interest in their attempts toward
including her as one of their circle.</p>
<p>She was courteous but plainly cared for
no one save Mrs. Burton, whose every wish
she seemed able to anticipate and fulfil.
Devoted as they were to their guardian, the
other girls had been entirely free from any
spirit of hero worship, so that Juliet Temple&rsquo;s
attitude became annoying.</p>
<p>To Miss Patricia it was more than annoying;
her disfavor increased daily. Yet
whatever story Juliet Temple had confided
to the Camp Fire guardian must have
aroused her sympathy. Mrs. Burton insisted
Juliet was not to leave Tahawus
cabin until she had secured surroundings in
which she could be content. And pleased
with her present environment apparently,
Juliet Temple made no especial effort to
discover any other abiding place, notwithstanding
Miss Patricia&rsquo;s open hostility.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>Moreover, there was no disputing the
obvious fact that she was useful to Mrs.
Burton, although the Camp Fire girls agreed
with Miss Patricia in not particularly liking
or trusting the latest member of their household,
and there was no thought of inviting
her to become one of the Sunrise Camp
Fire. So, perhaps for this reason, as well
as her personal devotion, Mrs. Burton
behaved toward the newcomer with especial
kindness.</p>
<p>Now and then sitting a little apart from
the group and fiercely engaged with her
knitting, Miss Patricia, after listening to the
reading aloud for half an hour or more,
would glance from Mrs. Burton to the girl
who managed always to be nearer to her
than any one else, and observing the expression
on the usually colorless and listless face,
would rise abruptly and stalk out of the
room. Occasionally Mrs. Burton would
follow her, but never was Miss Patricia
persuaded to return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2"><span class="sc">Spring</span></span></h2>
<p>Early spring had arrived in the
Adirondack forests. Little pools of
water lay in patches amid the snow
where the sun&rsquo;s rays shone with especial
warmth; down the sides of the mountains
one could hear the sounds of brooks released
from the winter fastness. Thin cakes of
ice still were floating on the surface of Half
Moon Lake, yet in the open spaces of clear
water one could see the reflection of the
spruce trees which all winter had stood
sentinel.</p>
<p>Now and then a water fowl appeared and
stopped to drink, and from deeper in the
woods occasionally there was a bird call,
poignant and sweet, and the barking of
young foxes at night, the beavers, having
come forth from their seclusion, were again
at work on new dams to meet the spring
freshets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>On the veranda in front of Tahawus cabin
Sally Ashton in a golden brown sweater and
tam-o-shanter was sweeping away light
patches of snow. Standing in the open
doorway Alice Ashton and Bettina Graham
were talking to their Camp Fire guardian,
who was walking rapidly up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why such a display of energy,
Tante, unless you are trying to keep warm.
Isn&rsquo;t it a heavenly day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton nodded and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to reduce my weight, Princess,
after so indolent a winter. But it is
wonderful to be alive on a day like this and
to feel so extraordinarily well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Camp Fire guardian walked to the
centre of the veranda and paused for a
moment, looking out at the landscape. The
sun appeared to be shining with a strange
brightness as if it also was feeling the year&rsquo;s
new birth. The sky was radiantly blue.</p>
<p>At this moment there was a faint noise
of a pony&rsquo;s hoofs striking against the stones
in the road and the next the Camp Fire
pony, hitched to a small wagon, appeared in
a turn of the road about an eighth of a mile
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll race you to see who gets the mail
first,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton called, and slipped off
the porch, running swiftly and lightly over
the damp earth, the three girls in pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, David Murray, please give the
letters to me, I&rsquo;ve won,&rdquo; she demanded,
slightly out of breath and holding up her
hands for the bag of mail, David having
drawn rein to watch the contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but of all the unfair races, this is
the climax!&rdquo; Alice protested, &ldquo;seeing that
you got away before the rest of us knew
what you intended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, Alice, but considering my age
and infirmities, I think I should have been
allowed a slight advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your age and infirmities are not particularly
apparent at this instant, Polly,&rdquo;
Miss Patricia announced drily from her seat
in the wagon where she and Vera Lagerloff
were enthroned surrounded by parcels,
&ldquo;but your lack of dignity undoubtedly is.
Do go to your room and do something to
your hair; this March wind has blown you
to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>If Miss Patricia&rsquo;s tone was severe, her
satisfaction was none the less visible. Moreover,
at this same instant her own strange,
little gray felt hat, which she affected
beyond all others, perhaps under the impression
that it was suited to her present
informal mode of life, had been tipped to
one side, giving her the eccentric appearance
to which her companions were accustomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Aunt Patricia, I am &lsquo;yours
obediently,&rsquo; as the old-fashioned letter
writers advise. Anyhow, I believe that is
the form of signature you like best from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton, slipping her arms through
Bettina Graham&rsquo;s and Alice&rsquo;s, started back
toward the cabin, Sally climbing into the
wagon beside David Murray, since she
objected to all unnecessary exertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder had I been so autocratic as a
Camp Fire guardian as Aunt Patricia has
been with me if I should have met with
equal success?&rdquo; Mrs. Burton inquired
laughingly.</p>
<p>Alice Ashton shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know, perhaps so. You
see, I have an idea that you are fairly apt
to do what you wish in important matters,
Tante, even if you do concede the smaller
ones.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton wrinkled her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean my keeping Juliet Temple
here with us this winter when neither you
girls nor Aunt Patricia like her? There
have been reasons I have not been able to
explain; besides, Juliet has been very kind
and useful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice Ashton shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was not thinking of Juliet Temple
or any particular case, but she will serve as
an example if you like.&rdquo; Alice appeared
entirely undisturbed, although her Camp
Fire guardian flushed and looked wounded.
Alice was not sensitive and had a fashion of
saying what seemed to her the truth without
any especial regard for consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, we should all have been glad
to have done for you whatever Juliet Temple
has done,&rdquo; Bettina added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear girls, you were busy with
your own work and studies and I did not
feel I had the right to interrupt you nor to
allow Aunt Patricia to exhaust herself
utterly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The subject was not an altogether happy
one, so there was no further reference to it.
A little later Mrs. Burton in the hall of the
cabin was distributing the morning mail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>Five minutes after she vanished to her
own bed-room carrying half a dozen letters.</p>
<p>The one from her husband she read
immediately, and then without glancing at
the others began walking up and down her
room, her buoyancy of a short time before
departed.</p>
<p>By and by she came back to a table where
she had thrown the other letters, and picking
them up studied the outside of the
envelopes with an abstracted air, as if her
mind were not intent upon her occupation.
Then she tore open a second letter, reading
it carelessly at first and afterwards with
closer attention.</p>
<p>She began walking a second time, with a
change of manner and as if she were thinking
deeply. Her straight brows became a
fairly level line, her blue eyes perceptibly
darkened, her lips closed more firmly than
usual.</p>
<p>At noon there was a knock at her door
and Juliet Temple entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please say that I am not coming in to
lunch, Juliet, and bring me something to
eat here. If possible, as I expect to be
busy, I&rsquo;d rather not be disturbed this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Mrs. Burton had but scant hope of Miss
Patricia&rsquo;s observing her wish and yet the
entire afternoon passed and no one came
near her.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, she did not appear to be
seriously occupied during the earlier part of
the afternoon. Instead she sat for an hour
before her fire with her hands tightly clasped.
Afterwards, drawing her writing table toward
her, she wrote a short note which she placed
in an envelope and addressed to her husband.
The second note was longer and
oddly enough addressed to Miss Patricia
Lord, who at present moment was not
many yards away. But this letter Mrs.
Burton placed inside her bureau drawer,
and then fell to packing a small suitcase
which she afterwards hid away in a closet.</p>
<p>She went in to supper and sat talking an
hour or more in the living-room with the
Camp Fire girls, but asked to be excused
early in the evening and again retired to her
own bed-room. She was undressing to put
on a tea-gown when the door opened and in
walked Miss Patricia looking uncommonly
severe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>&ldquo;I came in to inquire if you are ill, Polly,
or if there is any particular reason why you
have avoided our society all day? Really
you are one of the most unreasonable people
in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An instant Mrs. Burton hesitated, her
expression a little wistful, with almost a
childish appeal. Then conscious of Miss
Patricia&rsquo;s unrelenting air, and knowing her
inflexible will, she shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Aunt Patricia, I am not in the least
ill, in fact I rarely have felt better. But I
have had some business I wished to attend
to this afternoon and found it more convenient
to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Afterwards, when Miss Patricia, having
responded coldly to her good-night, had
departed, Mrs. Burton laughed and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am planning to behave like a child.
Actually I don&rsquo;t believe one of my Camp
Fire girls would be so absurd, but fortunately
for me I have never pretended to be
a model. The truth is I simply have not
the strength of character to oppose Aunt
Patricia until I am more definite in my
plans. But how I shall ever escape to New
York City to-morrow without being found
out is beyond my knowledge at present. I
simply must hope for some unexpected good
fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">220</div>
<p>The next morning Mrs. Burton, suddenly
having concluded that she had best have
Juliet Temple accompany her upon her
unexpected journey, explaining that she
wished to drive to Saranac, she and Juliet,
Sally Ashton and David Murray, started
forth, the small suitcase concealed beneath
the lap robe.</p>
<p>In choosing Sally Ashton for a measure
of confidence, Mrs. Burton appreciated that
one could always rely upon Sally&rsquo;s perfectly
matter-of-fact point of view and her openly
expressed conviction that every human being
possessed a right to their own choice of life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">221</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sally, I want you to do me a great
favor,&rdquo; Mrs. Burton explained when they
were almost in sight of the town. &ldquo;When
you return to the cabin will you look in my
bureau drawer, where you will find a letter
addressed to Aunt Patricia? Will you give
it to her at once? No, I am not going back
with you, I hope to be at home again by
day after to-morrow. I am on my way to
New York for a few days. I don&rsquo;t know
whether Aunt Patricia will reveal the fact
to you and it may be unnecessary, but I
yesterday received a letter from an old
friend asking me to talk over with him the
possibility of my appearing in a new play
in the early autumn. I am extremely well
and anxious to return to my work as you
girls know. Only, as I appreciate that
Aunt Patricia will not consent I wish to be
more sure myself before I discuss the situation
with her. I presume I am behaving
very badly, Sally dear, and have the grace
to be ashamed of myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response Sally dimpled and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose you are, nevertheless I
think you are sensible. After an argument
with Aunt Patricia you would have little
strength left to discuss business affairs in
New York, and besides you probably would
have to run away in the end in any case.
I&rsquo;ll present your letter, although I do think
you are asking a good deal of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sally, you are a joy forever!&rdquo; the Camp
Fire guardian returned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<p>Two days later after dusk, when the girls
and Miss Patricia had finished supper and
were in the living-room, an automobile drew
up before Tahawus cabin. Five minutes
after, Mrs. Burton stood in the center of
the circle of girls, who were helping her
remove her wraps.</p>
<p>Save for a curt nod of her head, Miss
Patricia Lord gave no further sign of being
aware of her presence.</p>
<p>A little later, as Mrs. Burton approached
her, she drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell us at once what decision you
have reached, Polly. Do you intend to
disregard your responsibility as a Camp
Fire guardian and the wishes of your family
and friends and return to the stage when
your health as well as your age make it
impossible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Burton shook her head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
<p>&ldquo;Really, Aunt Patricia, that is an unkind
fashion of presenting the situation and I
hope the girls will not agree with you. I
have no idea of giving up my position as
guardian so long as the Sunrise Camp Fire
girls do not desire some one else. In a
few weeks they will be leaving Tahawus
cabin and returning home and we have no
right to be selfish enough to ask them to
remain longer. As for me, I am entirely
well again, thanks to you. I saw a specialist
in New York and he agrees with the
doctor here that I need have no further
anxiety about myself. And I have had a
splendid offer which has made me very
happy. Really, Aunt Patricia, I am not
yet too old, but as I am becoming so, all
the more reason why I should return to the
stage immediately. I have not wished to
worry you, but the day before I left for New
York I received a very discouraging letter
from my husband telling me that some
stock in which we had invested more heavily
than we should had ceased to be of value.
So you must understand the necessity for
me to return to work as well as the pleasure.
I know, dear, that you would help us of
course, but it is not necessary and already
we have accepted too much from you. I
wrote Richard mentioning what I wished to
do, told him not to worry over the tiresome
stock, and he telegraphed his consent when
I was in New York. You&rsquo;ll come and live
with us; I&rsquo;m sure you will enjoy the winter.
I have been idling too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a silence in the room waiting for
Miss Patricia to reply. Finally she arose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you have arrived at your decision
without consulting me and knowing it to
be against my wish and judgment, Polly,
there is nothing for me to say. Only bear
in mind that our friendship is ended and I
shall never forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Patricia stalked out of the room.</p>
<p>Bettina Graham put her arm about Mrs.
Burton, who was slighter and small, and
drew her back inside the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to argue the question with
Aunt Patricia any more to-night, dear, you
are far too tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps next winter when you are in
New York some of us may also spend the
winter there; it is what I am hoping and
planning for a part of the year, as I wish
to take a special course at Columbia. I am
trying to induce father and mother to give
their consent,&rdquo; Alice Ashton remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such good fortune for me!&rdquo; Bettina
ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps it is as well that Tante
be separated from a few of us, if she is to
have time and strength for her own career.&rdquo;
Bettina made a graceful gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is wishing you greater fame and
fortune than ever before.&rdquo;</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
